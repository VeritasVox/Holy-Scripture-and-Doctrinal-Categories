## The Holy Scriptures

Holy Scripture is the inspired, inerrant Word of God, breathed out by Him in the original 66 canonical books (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21). God has preserved His Word so that it remains wholly trustworthy and sufficient for faith and life (Isaiah 40:8; Matthew 24:35). The Spirit illumines the hearts of the elect to rightly understand and receive it (1 Corinthians 2:12-14). Thus, Scripture is the final, sufficient, and unbreakable authority over all tradition, experience, and human reason.

### The Supreme Authority

Scripture is the **supreme authority** in the life of the Church, not tradition, experience, or human reasoning. It is sufficient for all matters of doctrine, life, and godliness—including ethics, worship, counseling, and governance. The Reformers recovered this truth under the banner of *sola Scriptura*, not because they despised tradition, but because they recognized that all human tradition must bow before divine revelation.

This does not mean that tradition, reason, or experience have no value. It means they have no *final* authority. They are servants of Scripture, not masters over it. When they align with Scripture, they are useful. When they contradict it, they must be rejected—no matter how ancient, how beloved, or how emotionally compelling they may be.

### The Spirit's Preservation and Illumination

The Holy Spirit **preserves the Word** through providence, ensuring that God's revelation is not lost to history or corrupted beyond recognition. The manuscript evidence for Scripture—particularly the New Testament—is unparalleled in the ancient world. God has not left His people without His Word.

The same Spirit who inspired Scripture **illumines** the minds of believers to rightly interpret and apply it (1 Corinthians 2:10-14). This does not mean that Scripture is unclear or that the Spirit gives private revelations about its meaning. It means that regenerate hearts, indwelt by the Spirit, have the capacity to understand and submit to what God has plainly said. The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit—not because Scripture is obscure, but because his heart is darkened (1 Corinthians 2:14).

### The Closed Canon

No new revelation will be given (Jude 3). The faith has been "once for all delivered to the saints." The canon is closed. All claims of extra-biblical authority—prophecies, visions, or subjective impressions—are **to be tested and rejected if they contradict or bypass Scripture** (Hebrews 1:1-2; Galatians 1:8-9).

This means that any teaching, no matter how compelling or emotionally powerful, that adds to Scripture, contradicts Scripture, or claims equal authority with Scripture is to be rejected. The Spirit never leads contrary to the Word He inspired. To claim that He does is to make God a liar and to accuse Him of contradiction.

### What Must Be Rejected

All teachings that subordinate the authority of Scripture to subjective experiences attributed to the Holy Spirit must be rejected. The modern charismatic movement's elevation of prophecy, visions, and "words from the Lord" above or alongside Scripture is a functional denial of *sola Scriptura*. The Spirit never leads contrary to the Word He inspired, and the canon is closed (2 Peter 1:20-21; Hebrews 1:1-2).

Experience must be tested by Scripture, not the reverse. Feelings must be judged by truth, not the reverse. The moment we allow subjective experience to interpret or override the plain meaning of Scripture, we have abandoned biblical authority and erected an idol in its place.

## The Interpretation of Scripture

Scripture is to be interpreted with fear, not freedom. It is not raw material for spiritual reflection, but divine revelation with fixed meaning—determined by the Spirit-inspired authors and received through reverent exegesis. Interpretation is not creativity; it is submission. The Bible is not a spiritual mirror, a theological sandbox, or a devotional buffet. It is the Word of the living God, and it speaks with objective, binding authority.

### The Meaning of Scripture Is Singular and Knowable

The meaning of Scripture is singular, knowable, and grounded in the author's intent—not in the reader's perspective. God spoke through human authors, and those authors meant something specific. Our task is not to discover what the text means *to us*, but what it meant *to them*—and by extension, what God intended it to mean for all people, in all times, in all places.

This does not mean that Scripture has no application beyond its original context. It means that application must flow from interpretation, not replace it. We do not get to decide what the text means based on how it makes us feel or what would be convenient for our situation. God has spoken. Our job is to listen and obey.

### Proper Interpretation Requires

1. **Pericope-level fidelity** — Every verse must be understood in its immediate literary unit. Context is not optional. A verse plucked from its surrounding passage is a verse divorced from its meaning.

2. **Authorial intent** — What the inspired human writer meant under the Spirit's superintendence is what the text means. The Spirit did not bypass the human authors; He worked through them. To ignore authorial intent is to ignore the means God chose to reveal Himself.

3. **Canonical unity** — Scripture interprets Scripture. God does not contradict Himself. If your interpretation of one passage makes it contradict another, you have misunderstood at least one of them.

4. **Doctrinal coherence** — No meaning is valid if it contradicts God's nature, the gospel, or the moral law. God is holy, just, and good. Any interpretation that makes Him appear otherwise is false.

5. **Covenantal clarity** — The distinction and continuity of Law and Gospel, promise and fulfillment, must be preserved. The Old Testament is not irrelevant, but it must be read through the lens of Christ and the new covenant.

### What Must Be Rejected

All interpretive frameworks that subordinate the plain meaning of Scripture to external authorities must be rejected—whether tradition, ecclesiastical decree, personal experience, mystical impression, cultural mood, or institutional consensus. No pope, council, denomination, confession, or movement has the right to redefine what God has said. The Church is a pillar of the truth, not its architect (1 Timothy 3:15).

The use of "mystery," "tension," or "humility" as theological camouflage to soften hard doctrines, reverse clear commands, or elevate confusion as a virtue must also be rejected. God is not vague. His Word is not a fog. His commands are not open to negotiation.

There are genuine mysteries in Scripture—truths that transcend human comprehension (e.g., the Trinity, the incarnation, divine sovereignty and human responsibility). But these are mysteries *revealed*, not mysteries *concealed*. God has told us what we need to know, and He has done so clearly. The failure to interpret rightly is not due to obscurity in God's Word, but rebellion in man's heart.

### The Seriousness of Interpretation

God has spoken clearly, consistently, and finally. Scripture is not a kaleidoscope of meanings, but a unified revelation of divine truth. To mishandle Scripture is to misrepresent God. To interpret without fear is to speak where angels would tremble.

> *"Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth."* (2 Timothy 2:15)

The stakes are eternal. How we interpret Scripture determines how we understand God, how we proclaim the gospel, and how we live our lives. Carelessness in interpretation is not a minor academic failing—it is spiritual malpractice.

## Biblical Foundation for Doctrinal Categories

The framework of primary, secondary, and conscience-level doctrines is not an arbitrary human construct but is grounded in Scripture's own categories and the apostolic example. This section establishes the exegetical foundation for doctrinal triage by examining key texts that demonstrate how Scripture itself distinguishes between essential, important, and disputable matters.

### Romans 14:1-15:7: The Apostolic Framework for Disputable Matters

Paul's extended treatment of "disputable matters" (διακρίσεις διαλογισμῶν, *diakriseis dialogismōn*, 14:1) provides the clearest biblical framework for what we call matters of conscience and secondary doctrines.

#### What Qualifies as Disputable (14:1-4)

Paul identifies the principle: "As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions" (14:1). The Greek word for "opinions" is διαλογισμῶν (*dialogismōn*), referring to internal reasonings or scruples. These are matters where Scripture does not give a binding command, and godly believers can differ based on conscience.

Paul gives two examples:
- **Food** (14:2-3): "One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats."
- **Days** (14:5-6): "One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind."

The key principle: neither position is condemned as sin. Both can be done "to the Lord" (14:6). This establishes that not all differences constitute false teaching or grounds for exclusion.

#### Full Conviction in Conscience (14:5, 22-23)

The phrase "fully convinced" (πληροφορείσθω, *plērophoreisthō*, 14:5) means to be completely assured or certain. Paul commands that each person must have full conviction in their own mind about disputable matters. This is not permission for doubt about clear doctrines, but a command regarding matters Scripture leaves to conscience.

Critically, verse 23 states: "But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin." The violation of conscience—even an overly scrupulous conscience—is sin. This means that forcing someone to violate their conscience on a disputable matter is to cause them to sin.

#### Liberty Bounded by Love (14:13-21)

Paul shifts from defending liberty to limiting it: "Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother" (14:13).

The word "stumbling block" (σκάνδαλον, *skandalon*, 14:13) refers to something that causes another to fall into sin or to violate their conscience. Liberty must be exercised with love. The strong must bear with the weak, not flaunt their freedom in ways that cause the weak to stumble.

Verse 21 summarizes: "It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble." This is not a binding command to abstain, but a principle of love: where my liberty would cause a weaker brother to sin by violating his conscience, love restrains my liberty.

#### Unity in Essentials (15:5-7)

Paul concludes with a call to unity grounded in the gospel: "May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God" (15:5-7).

Unity is not uniformity on disputable matters. It is shared submission to Christ, shared worship of God, and mutual welcome despite differences on secondary issues. The standard is: "as Christ has welcomed you"—and Christ welcomed us while we were yet sinners, not after we had achieved doctrinal perfection.

### 1 Corinthians 8-10: The Idol Meat Case Study

These chapters provide an extended case study in how to navigate the intersection of doctrine, conscience, and practice. The issue: meat offered to idols in pagan temples, then sold in the marketplace. May Christians eat it?

#### Knowledge vs. Love (8:1-3)

Paul begins with a warning: "Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that 'all of us possess knowledge.' This knowledge puffs up, but love builds up" (8:1). The Corinthians were right in their theology—idols are nothing, and food doesn't commend us to God (8:4, 8). But they were wrong in their application, because they lacked love.

Knowledge alone is insufficient. Truth must be applied with wisdom and love, considering the impact on weaker brothers.

#### Liberty vs. Stumbling Block (8:9-13)

Paul identifies the danger: "But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block (πρόσκομμα, *proskomma*) to the weak" (8:9). If a weaker brother with a sensitive conscience sees a stronger brother eating in an idol's temple, he may be emboldened to do the same—but against his conscience, thus sinning.

Verse 11 is sobering: "And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died." The abuse of liberty can cause spiritual harm, even destruction.

Paul's conclusion: "Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble" (8:13). This is voluntary self-limitation for the sake of love, not a binding law.

#### The Boundary: Idolatry Itself Is Non-Negotiable (10:14-22)

After defending liberty and urging its limitation for love's sake, Paul draws a hard line: "Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry" (10:14). Eating meat sold in the market is permissible (10:25-26). Eating at a friend's house without inquiry is permissible (10:27). But participating in pagan worship is absolutely forbidden: "You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons" (10:21).

This demonstrates the principle: where Scripture gives liberty, we have liberty (bounded by love). Where Scripture draws a line, there is no liberty. Idolatry is not a matter of conscience—it is sin, period.

### Matthew 18:15-20: Christ's Process for Church Discipline

Jesus provides the authoritative process for dealing with sin in the church, establishing a graduated, relational approach that escalates only as necessary.

#### Step 1: Private Confrontation (18:15)

"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."

The goal is restoration, not punishment. The first step is always private, personal, and aimed at repentance and reconciliation.

#### Step 2: Two or Three Witnesses (18:16)

"But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."

This follows Deuteronomy 19:15, ensuring that accusations are verified and the confrontation is witnessed. It also provides additional voices to call the brother to repentance.

#### Step 3: Tell It to the Church (18:17a)

"If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church."

The matter becomes public, involving the whole congregation. This is not gossip but biblical process. The church now has the responsibility to call the brother to repentance.

#### Step 4: Treat as an Outsider (18:17b)

"And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."

Persistent, unrepentant sin results in exclusion from fellowship. The brother is to be treated as an unbeliever—not with hatred, but without the fellowship and recognition granted to believers in good standing.

#### Binding and Loosing Authority (18:18-20)

"Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."

The church's discipline is ratified in heaven. When the church exercises discipline according to Christ's process, it acts with His authority. This is not autonomous power but delegated authority to declare what God has already determined.

### Galatians 1:6-9; 2:11-14: Gospel Boundaries and Public Confrontation

Paul demonstrates both the non-negotiable nature of the gospel and the appropriateness of public rebuke when the gospel is at stake.

#### Anathema for False Gospels (1:6-9)

"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed (ἀνάθεμα, *anathema*). As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed."

Paul pronounces a divine curse on anyone—even an apostle or an angel—who preaches a false gospel. The gospel is non-negotiable. There is no room for compromise, no call for dialogue, no plea for unity across gospel lines. False gospels damn souls, and those who preach them are under God's curse.

The repetition in verse 9 intensifies the warning. This is not Paul's passion getting the better of him—this is settled apostolic teaching.

#### Public Rebuke of Peter (2:11-14)

"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party. And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy. But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all..."

Peter was not denying the gospel verbally. But his actions were functionally communicating a false gospel—that Gentiles needed to become Jews to be fully accepted. Paul's response was immediate and public. He "opposed him to his face" and rebuked him "before them all."

This establishes several principles:
- Actions can contradict the gospel as much as words
- When the gospel is at stake, public confrontation is appropriate
- Even apostles are not above correction
- The standard is "the truth of the gospel," not personal offense

### Acts 15: The Apostolic Council and Essential vs. Non-Essential Distinctions

The Jerusalem Council provides a historical example of the apostles navigating a major doctrinal controversy and drawing clear lines between essential and non-essential matters.

#### The Question (15:1-5)

"But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, 'Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.'"

This was a gospel issue. The Judaizers were adding a requirement to salvation beyond faith in Christ. Paul and Barnabas opposed them sharply, leading to the council in Jerusalem.

#### The Process (15:6-21)

The apostles and elders gathered to consider the matter. Peter recounted God's acceptance of the Gentiles through faith alone (15:7-11). Paul and Barnabas testified to God's work among the Gentiles (15:12). James provided the theological framework and proposed a resolution (15:13-21).

#### The Decision (15:22-29)

The council issued a decree: Gentiles do not need to be circumcised or keep the law of Moses to be saved. However, for the sake of unity and to avoid unnecessary offense, they should "abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood" (15:20).

This decision distinguished:
- **Essential (Primary)**: Faith in Christ alone for salvation—non-negotiable
- **Wisdom (Secondary/Conscience)**: Certain practices (food restrictions) recommended for the sake of Jewish-Gentile unity, but not salvifically necessary

The letter concludes: "For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements" (15:28). The apostles recognized that adding to the gospel was intolerable, but making practical concessions for unity was wise.

### Supporting Texts for the Posture Clause

The principle that heart posture can elevate any issue to primary status is grounded in several key texts:

#### Hebrews 10:26-27

"For if we go on sinning deliberately (ἑκουσίως ἁμαρτανόντων, *hekousiōs hamartanontōn*) after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries."

The word ἑκουσίως (*hekousiōs*) means "willfully, voluntarily, of one's own accord." This is not inadvertent sin or weakness, but deliberate, persistent rebellion after clear knowledge of the truth. Such willful sin demonstrates a heart that has never been changed by the gospel.

#### 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12

"...and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness."

They perish not merely because they were ignorant, but because "they refused to love the truth." This is active resistance to known truth. God's judicial hardening follows their willful rejection.

#### Proverbs 29:1

"He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck, will suddenly be broken beyond healing."

Repeated correction met with stubborn resistance leads to judgment. The pattern of rebellion, not a single error, reveals the state of the heart.

### Summary

These passages establish the biblical framework for doctrinal triage:

1. **Scripture itself distinguishes** between essential doctrines (the gospel, Christ's person and work, God's nature), important but not salvific matters (ecclesiology, eschatology), and matters left to conscience (food, days, cultural practices).

2. **The church has authority** to exercise discipline according to Christ's process (Matthew 18), to pronounce anathema on false teachers (Galatians 1:8-9), and to make practical distinctions for the sake of unity (Acts 15).

3. **Liberty must be exercised in love** (Romans 14; 1 Corinthians 8-10). Knowledge without love destroys. Freedom without wisdom causes stumbling.

4. **Heart posture determines ultimate standing**. Willful, persistent rejection of known truth—even on what might otherwise be a secondary matter—reveals a heart that has never submitted to Christ (Hebrews 10:26-27; 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12).

The framework that follows is not imposed on Scripture but drawn from it.

## Doctrinal Categories: Understanding Biblical Priorities

God has spoken with clarity in His Word, and His revelation must be handled with reverence, precision, and submission (Deuteronomy 29:29; Psalm 119:160; 2 Timothy 3:16-17). The church is called to uphold the whole counsel of God (Acts 20:27), not merely salvific minimums. Doctrinal reductionism—the attempt to avoid biblical conflict by flattening theological distinctions—must be rejected.

The categories that follow are not derived from cultural tradition or denominational convenience, but from Scripture's own categories, consequences, and commands. Not all doctrines carry the same weight, and the Bible itself demonstrates this. The question is not whether we will distinguish between doctrines, but whether we will do so biblically.

---

## Primary Doctrine: Salvific and Worship-Defining

A doctrine is primary when its denial results in one or more of the following:

- **Worshiping a false god** (Exodus 20:3; John 4:24)
- **Preaching a false gospel** (Galatians 1:8-9)
- **Violating God's design for the church or His moral law** (1 Timothy 3:15; Hebrews 10:26-31)
- **Persistent disobedience that reflects spiritual rebellion** (1 Corinthians 16:22; Hebrews 3:12-13)

Primary doctrines are rooted in:

- The nature and attributes of God
- The person and work of Jesus Christ
- The person and work of the Holy Spirit
- The created order as affirmed under the New Covenant
- The structure of salvation: election, atonement, regeneration, justification, sanctification, glorification

Scripture never treats these doctrines as optional, situational, or left to personal liberty. They are non-negotiable, and refusal to submit to correction on these truths places one outside the bounds of biblical fellowship.

> *"If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed."* (1 Corinthians 16:22)

> *"They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved."* (2 Thessalonians 2:10)

### Trinitarian Coherence: All Three Persons Rightly Understood

It is insufficient to affirm orthodox Christology while maintaining heretical views of the Father or the Spirit. The doctrine of God is indivisible—to misrepresent one person of the Trinity is to worship a false god, even if the other two persons are rightly confessed.

**The Trinitarian Requirement:**
- The **Father** must be confessed as sovereign, omnipotent, and whose will is never ultimately frustrated by creatures (Isaiah 46:10; Ephesians 1:11)
- The **Son** must be confessed as fully God and fully man, whose atoning work actually accomplishes what the Father intended (John 6:37-39; 17:2)
- The **Spirit** must be confessed as God, whose regenerating work is effectual and not subject to ultimate human veto (John 3:8; 6:63; Ezekiel 36:26-27)

**The Unity of Divine Will:**
The three persons share one divine essence and therefore one divine will in purpose and power, though they have distinct roles in the economy of salvation (*opera trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa* - the external works of the Trinity are undivided). Any system that posits ultimately conflicting wills between the persons, divine frustration by human resistance, or impotence in accomplishing the decreed purposes of salvation has not merely erred on soteriology—it has embraced a false doctrine of God.

**Examples of Functional Tritheism:**

**Arminian soteriology**, when consistently applied, results in:
- The **Father** willing to save all people without exception
- The **Son** dying to make salvation possible for all without actually securing it for any
- The **Spirit** attempting to regenerate all hearers but being ultimately resistible by human will

This creates three divine persons with:
- **Different ultimate intentions** (Father wills all saved, but not all are saved)
- **Frustrated purposes** (God's saving will is thwarted by human choice)
- **Impotent execution** (The Spirit's regenerating work can be finally resisted)

This is not the triune God of Scripture, but three separate divine beings whose wills can conflict and whose purposes can be defeated. It functionally denies divine omnipotence, the efficacy of Christ's atonement, and the sovereignty of the Spirit's work.

**The Test:**
Ask: Does this system require that the Father, Son, and Spirit have ultimately conflicting wills? Does it make the success of salvation dependent on human will rather than divine will? Does it posit divine purposes that can be finally frustrated? If yes to any of these, the system has not merely erred on soteriology—it has departed from trinitarian orthodoxy.

**Other Examples:**
- **Modalism** - denies the distinct persons (Father, Son, Spirit are just modes of one person)
- **Arianism** - denies the full deity of the Son
- **Subordinationism** - makes the Son or Spirit ontologically inferior to the Father
- **Tritheism** (explicit) - three separate gods cooperating
- **Functional Tritheism** - orthodox language about three persons, but systems that require conflicting wills or frustrated purposes

All of these constitute worship of a false god, regardless of which person is misrepresented.

### Case Examples

**Uzzah touching the ark** (2 Samuel 6:6-7) — God's holiness and prescribed worship were violated, and the consequence was death. Uzzah's intentions may have been sincere, but his action showed contempt for God's command. Sincerity does not excuse disobedience.

**Nadab and Abihu offering unauthorized fire** (Leviticus 10:1-2) — Innovation in worship apart from God's command brought immediate judgment. God had given specific instructions for worship, and they chose to do what seemed right in their own eyes. They died for it.

**Peter's gospel-compromising hypocrisy at Antioch** (Galatians 2:11-14) — Paul confronted Peter publicly because his behavior undermined the truth of the gospel. Peter was not denying the gospel with his words, but his actions were functionally communicating a false gospel. Paul did not allow this to stand.

**Job's friends misrepresenting God** (Job 42:7-9) — God declared that they had not spoken rightly about Him, requiring sacrifice and intercession. They thought they were defending God's honor. Instead, they were bearing false witness against His character. God does not take misrepresentation lightly.

### The Role of Heart Posture

Heart posture matters profoundly. Defiant reinterpretation or refusal to obey transforms secondary errors into primary rebellion. Willful, corrected-yet-unrepentant disobedience is always a gospel issue (Hebrews 10:26-27). As Titus 2:11-12 declares, *"Grace trains us to renounce ungodliness."* Grace is not permission to remain in error—it is power to forsake it.

A person who is merely ignorant or confused but teachable is in a different category than a person who has been shown the truth and chooses to reject it. The former may be a brother in need of instruction. The latter is in danger of proving himself no brother at all.

---

## Secondary Doctrine: Ecclesial and Disciplinary, Not Salvific

A doctrine is secondary when:

- It is taught in Scripture, but not directly tied to salvation or the being of God
- Denial causes disorder or division, but not apostasy
- Scripture addresses it with gravity but permits ongoing fellowship among true believers (Romans 14:1-9; 1 Corinthians 8:1-13)

These doctrines may shape church practice, require denominational distinction, or necessitate practical separation for clarity and order, yet they do not constitute false gospels or idolatry.

### Examples

**Baptism mode** (immersion vs. covenantal inclusion) — Both positions affirm the necessity of baptism and its connection to Christ, but differ on the mode and subjects. Baptists and Presbyterians have maintained separate denominations over this issue for centuries, yet both recognize each other as genuine Christians.

**Eschatology** (amillennial vs. premillennial) — So long as it does not deny key gospel realities such as the bodily return of Christ, final judgment, or resurrection, differences in eschatological frameworks are secondary. The Bible speaks about the end times, but Christians have disagreed on the details without dividing over the gospel.

Secondary doctrines are not indifferent. They affect discipleship, unity, and worship. But disagreement here does not sever covenant standing in Christ. As Romans 14:5 says, *"Let each be fully convinced in his own mind."*

### Warnings on Secondary Matters

Secondary does not mean unimportant. Churches may—and often should—separate over secondary matters for the sake of clarity, order, and missional effectiveness. A Baptist church should not practice infant baptism, and a Presbyterian church should not practice believer's baptism only. This is not sectarianism—it is integrity.

The boundary between secondary and primary can also shift when a secondary issue is weaponized to undermine a primary doctrine. For example, baptismal regeneration (the belief that baptism itself saves) distorts justification by faith alone and therefore becomes a gospel issue. The mode of baptism is secondary; the efficacy of baptism as a saving act is primary.

---

## Matters of Conscience: Liberty Without License

An issue qualifies as a matter of conscience only when:

- Scripture gives no binding command
- Both positions do not violate God's moral law, creation order, or gospel terms
- It can be practiced unto the Lord in faith (Romans 14:6)
- It does not alter the elements of worship, ordained offices, or sacraments

### Examples

- **Dietary restrictions** (Romans 14:2-3) — Whether to eat meat or abstain is a matter of conscience, so long as it is done in faith and does not cause a weaker brother to stumble.
- **Alcohol consumption** (Romans 14:21; 1 Timothy 5:23) — Scripture condemns drunkenness, not drinking. Some may abstain entirely; others may drink in moderation. Neither violates God's command.
- **Sabbath observance** (Romans 14:5-6; Colossians 2:16) — Whether to observe a particular day as holy or to treat all days alike is left to conscience under the new covenant.
- **Clothing styles** (within the bounds of modesty—1 Timothy 2:9) — Cultural expressions of modesty may vary, but the principle of modesty is binding.
- **Cultural traditions** not tied to idolatry or syncretism — Celebrating holidays, using certain forms of music, etc., are matters of conscience unless they involve worship of false gods or syncretism with pagan practices.

> *"Whatever does not proceed from faith is sin."* (Romans 14:23)

### Warnings on Conscience

Two dangers threaten Christian liberty:

1. **Elevating conscience to law results in legalism** (Colossians 2:16-23) — Turning preferences into moral absolutes binds the conscience where God has left it free. The Pharisees did this, and Jesus condemned them for it.

2. **Using liberty to justify sin results in license** (Galatians 5:13; Jude 4) — Freedom in Christ is not freedom to sin, but freedom to obey from the heart. Grace is not permission—it is power.

Conscience is a God-given faculty, but it must be informed by Scripture and held accountable to it. A "clear conscience" that contradicts God's Word is simply a seared conscience (1 Timothy 4:2). Paul could say he had a clear conscience (Acts 23:1), but he also acknowledged that his conscience was not the final judge—God was (1 Corinthians 4:4).

## Structural Safeguards

### 1. Covenantal Filter

Old Covenant laws apply only through the fulfillment and reinterpretation of the New Covenant. This guards against Mosaic legalism. Not every command in the Old Testament carries forward unchanged. Christ is the end of the law for righteousness (Romans 10:4), and the Mosaic covenant has been superseded by the new covenant in His blood (Hebrews 8:13).

This does not mean the Old Testament is irrelevant. It means that it must be read through Christ. The moral law—summarized in the Ten Commandments and repeated in the New Testament—remains binding. The ceremonial law has been fulfilled in Christ. The civil law was given to Israel as a nation and does not apply directly to the church or modern states.

**Examples of applying the Covenantal Filter:**

- **Sabbath principle**: The moral principle of rest and worship continues (Hebrews 4:9-11); the specific seventh-day requirement does not bind Christians (Romans 14:5-6; Colossians 2:16-17)
- **Dietary laws**: Fulfilled in Christ; no longer binding (Mark 7:19; Acts 10:15; 1 Timothy 4:3-5)
- **Sacrificial system**: Fulfilled in Christ's once-for-all sacrifice; to continue animal sacrifices would be blasphemous denial of Christ's sufficiency (Hebrews 10:1-18)
- **Moral law**: The substance carries forward unchanged, now written on hearts by the Spirit (Jeremiah 31:33; Romans 8:4; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10)
- **Civil penalties**: Specific to Israel's theocratic administration; not binding on nations or church (e.g., stoning for Sabbath-breaking, execution for adultery under Mosaic code)

### 2. Posture Clause

Defiance in any category elevates the issue to primary; rebellion is always salvific. A person who refuses correction on a secondary matter reveals a heart problem that transcends the issue itself. The mark of regeneration is teachability (Psalm 25:9; James 1:21). Obstinate resistance to clear biblical teaching—even on secondary matters—raises serious questions about a person's standing before God.

**Scripture demonstrates this pattern:**
- **Hebrews 10:26-27** warns of those who sin willfully (ἑκουσίως, *hekousiōs*) after receiving knowledge of truth
- **2 Thessalonians 2:10-12** speaks of those who perish because they refused to love the truth
- **Proverbs 29:1** warns: "He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck, will suddenly be broken beyond healing"

This means that someone who is wrong about a secondary issue but humble and teachable is in a different category than someone who is right about a secondary issue but proud and unteachable. God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble (James 4:6).

### 3. Dual-Level Clarity

Some doctrines (e.g., baptism) may be secondary salvifically but primary ecclesially. This means that while disagreement on baptism does not necessarily exclude someone from salvation, it may require separation at the level of church membership or leadership. The Bible permits flexibility on some matters within the universal church while still requiring clarity and consistency within the local church.

**Practical Application:**
- A local church must maintain coherent, consistent practice. A congregation cannot simultaneously practice infant baptism and restrict baptism to professing believers only.
- But a Baptist church can recognize Presbyterian Christians as genuine believers while maintaining that they are wrong about baptism.
- Denominations are often legitimate expressions of secondary differences maintained for clarity and coherence.
- Partnership in ministry requires shared ecclesial commitments, not just salvific agreement.

**Other examples of dual-level doctrines:**
- Church government (elder-led vs. congregational)
- Eschatology (amillennial vs. premillennial)
- Continuationism vs. cessationism (regarding spiritual gifts)

These warrant denominational distinction and may limit certain partnerships, but do not constitute false gospels or grounds for treating someone as unsaved.

### 4. Hermeneutical Integrity

All interpretation must uphold authorial intent, covenantal structure, and doctrinal coherence. God does not contradict Himself. The analogy of faith—interpreting Scripture with Scripture—is not optional. Any interpretation that sets one passage against another, or that makes God appear unjust, unloving, or inconsistent, is to be rejected.

This is why systematic theology is necessary. We do not interpret isolated texts—we interpret texts in light of the whole counsel of God. The Bible is one book with one divine Author, and it speaks with one voice.

## Progressive Discipline and the Stages of Departure

Scripture distinguishes between various categories of doctrinal error and spiritual danger, each requiring different pastoral responses. The progression from immaturity to apostasy reveals not only the state of the individual but also the church's responsibility to exercise discernment, discipline, and—where possible—restoration.

This framework is not arbitrary but is drawn from the biblical pattern of how the apostles and early church dealt with sin, error, and departure. The goal is always restoration where possible, but also the protection of the flock and the glory of God's name.

### Stage 1: The Immature/Carnal Christian (1 Corinthians 3:1-3)

**Description:**
The immature Christian is genuinely regenerate but walking according to the flesh in certain areas. Paul addresses the Corinthians as "brothers" (ἀδελφοί, *adelphoi*, 3:1), affirming their status in Christ, yet rebukes them sharply: "But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, for you are still of the flesh."

**Characteristics:**
- Genuine faith but spiritual immaturity
- Feeding on "milk" (basic teachings) rather than "solid food" (deeper doctrine)
- Jealousy, strife, and divisions (3:3)
- Behaving "like ordinary people" rather than as the redeemed

**Pastoral Response:**
Patient teaching, discipleship, bearing with weakness (Romans 15:1). The strong must bear with the failings of the weak, not for their own pleasure but for their neighbor's good (Romans 15:1-2).

**Key Distinction:**
Immaturity is not apostasy. Spiritual childhood is normal and expected for new believers. The issue is not the presence of immaturity but the persistence of it. The author of Hebrews rebukes those who should be teachers but still need milk (Hebrews 5:12-14). Growth is expected; perpetual infancy is concerning.

**Timeframe:**
Indefinite patience with genuine immaturity, but growing concern if there is no growth over time.

### Stage 2: The Brother Caught in Sin (Galatians 6:1; James 5:19-20)

**Description:**
A genuine believer who has fallen into particular sin. This is not habitual, willful rebellion but a stumbling—a moral failure that requires intervention and correction.

**Biblical Texts:**
- **Galatians 6:1**: "Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted."
- **James 5:19-20**: "My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins."

**Pastoral Response:**
Gentle restoration by the spiritual, with humility and self-awareness. The goal is not condemnation but recovery. Those who intervene must "keep watch" on themselves, recognizing their own vulnerability to temptation.

**Timeframe:**
Immediate intervention when discovered. Delay in confronting sin is not love but cowardice.

**Goal:**
Restoration to fellowship and holiness. The restoration is not merely outward conformity but genuine repentance and renewed obedience.

### Stage 3: Brother Under Formal Discipline (Matthew 18:15-17; 1 Corinthians 5)

**Description:**
Sin that persists after private confrontation, requiring escalating involvement of the church. This is not a single stumble but a pattern of unrepentant behavior that threatens both the individual's soul and the church's witness.

**Christ's Process (Matthew 18:15-17):**

**Step 1: One-on-One Confrontation (18:15)**
"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."

The matter begins privately. The goal is always restoration, not exposure. If the brother repents at this stage, the matter is resolved.

**Step 2: Two or Three Witnesses (18:16)**
"But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."

This follows Deuteronomy 19:15, ensuring that accusations are verified and the confrontation is witnessed. The additional voices serve both as corroboration and as further appeal to the brother's conscience.

**Step 3: Tell It to the Church (18:17a)**
"If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church."

The matter becomes public, involving the whole congregation. This is not gossip but biblical process. The church now has the responsibility to call the brother to repentance. Public sin requires public discipline.

**Step 4: Treat as an Outsider (18:17b)**
"And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."

Persistent, unrepentant sin results in exclusion from fellowship. The brother is to be treated as an unbeliever—not with hatred or cruelty, but without the fellowship and recognition granted to believers in good standing. He is no longer to be received as a brother.

**When Immediate Church Discipline Is Required (1 Corinthians 5):**

Some sins are so public, scandalous, and destructive that they require immediate church-level action without the graduated process. Paul addresses the case of a man in an incestuous relationship: "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father's wife" (1 Corinthians 5:1).

Paul's command is immediate and severe: "Let him who has done this be removed from among you" (5:2). The church is to "deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord" (5:5).

**The Nature of the Sin Matters:**
- Private sin may follow the Matthew 18 process
- Public, scandalous sin that is known to the congregation and brings reproach on Christ's name requires immediate, public discipline

**Goal:**
Even in severe discipline, the goal remains redemptive: "so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord" (1 Corinthians 5:5). Discipline is not vengeance but rescue.

### Stage 4: The Divisive/Factious Person (Titus 3:10-11)

**Description:**
A person who causes division in the church, not necessarily by denying primary doctrine, but by creating factions, stirring up controversy, and undermining unity and order.

**Biblical Text:**
"As for a person who stirs up division (αἱρετικὸν ἄνθρωπον, *hairetikon anthrōpon*), after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him, knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned."

The word αἱρετικός (*hairetikos*) is the root of our word "heretic," but in this context it refers primarily to a divisive, factious person—one who chooses (αἱρέομαι, *haireomai*) his own way over the church's unity.

**Pastoral Response:**
First warning, second warning, then rejection. This is more lenient than discipline for gross sin (which may be immediate), but stricter than patience with mere immaturity (which can extend indefinitely).

**Timeframe:**
Limited to two warnings. After that, "have nothing more to do with him."

**Why the Severity?**
Division is uniquely destructive. It undermines the church's unity, distracts from the gospel, and can spread like gangrene (2 Timothy 2:17). Those who persist in causing division after repeated warnings demonstrate that they love their own agenda more than the church's peace.

### Stage 5: Anathema - Declared Exclusion (Galatians 1:8-9; 1 Corinthians 16:22; 1 Corinthians 5:3-5)

**What Anathema Is:**

Anathema (ἀνάθεμα, *anathema*) means "devoted to destruction" or "under a curse." It is a formal, ecclesiastical declaration of exclusion from fellowship, pronounced by the church (or apostolic authority) on specific biblical grounds.

**Primary Grounds for Anathema:**
1. **Preaching a false gospel** (Galatians 1:8-9)
2. **Persistent, unrepentant sin** after church discipline (1 Corinthians 5:3-5)
3. **Refusing to love the Lord** (1 Corinthians 16:22)

**Biblical Examples:**

**Galatians 1:8-9**: "But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed (ἀνάθεμα). As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed."

Paul pronounces anathema—a divine curse—on anyone who preaches a false gospel. This is not a wish or a warning; it is an apostolic declaration.

**1 Corinthians 16:22**: "If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed (ἀνάθεμα). Our Lord, come!"

To have no love for Christ is to be under God's curse. This is the most fundamental test of regeneration.

**1 Corinthians 5:5**: "You are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."

The church formally excludes the unrepentant man from fellowship, handing him over to Satan's domain (the world outside the church). This is anathema in practice.

**Critical Distinction - Anathema vs. Apostasy:**

This is where many confuse categories. Anathema and apostasy are related but distinct.

**Anathema** is:
- **Declared by the church** based on observable conduct and teaching
- **Aimed at shocking the person to repentance** (1 Corinthians 5:5 - "so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord")
- **Reversible upon genuine repentance** (the likely case in 2 Corinthians 2:5-11)
- A **means of discipline**, not necessarily a final verdict on their eternal state
- **The church's assessment** of their current standing

**Apostasy** is:
- **Revealed by the person's final departure** and hardened unrepentance
- **Not declared by the church** but discerned through their response
- **Proves they were never truly regenerate** (1 John 2:19)
- **Irreversible** (Hebrews 6:4-6 - "impossible to restore them again to repentance")
- **God's verdict** on their eternal state

**The Overlap and Difference:**

When the church pronounces anathema on someone, we cannot know with certainty whether they are:
1. A **backslidden saint** who will eventually repent and return (like the man in 1 Corinthians 5, likely restored in 2 Corinthians 2)
2. An **apostate** who will never repent because they were never truly saved (like those described in 1 John 2:19)

**Time reveals the difference:**
- If they repent and return → they were a sinning saint under discipline
- If they depart finally and never return → they were an apostate who was never regenerate

**Practical Implications:**

1. **Pronounce anathema when Scripture requires it**. When someone preaches a false gospel, persists in scandalous sin, or shows no love for Christ, the church must act. This is obedience, not cruelty.

2. **Do not presume to know their eternal state**. We can and must say, "Based on your current teaching/behavior, you are outside the faith and under God's curse." We cannot say with certainty, "You are eternally damned and can never be saved."

3. **Continue to pray for their repentance**. Even under anathema, we hope and pray that God will grant them repentance. The purpose of "delivering to Satan" is "so that his spirit may be saved" (1 Corinthians 5:5).

4. **Recognize that restoration is possible**. If they repent genuinely, the church must forgive and restore them (2 Corinthians 2:5-11). Anathema is not permanent exile—it is a drastic measure to provoke repentance.

5. **But also recognize that final departure may reveal they were never saved**. If they harden in their error, continue in their sin, and ultimately depart from the faith, their apostasy proves they were never truly born again (1 John 2:19).

### Stage 6: Apostasy - Revealed Departure (Hebrews 6:4-6; 10:26-31; 1 John 2:19; 2 Peter 2:20-22)

**What Apostasy Is:**

Apostasy is the final, willful rejection of Christ after exposure to the gospel and (apparent) participation in the covenant community. It is not a category the church *declares*, but a reality the church *discerns* based on the person's persistent, hardened departure from the faith.

**Biblical Texts:**

**1 John 2:19**: "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us."

Apostates depart to reveal what was always true: they were never genuinely regenerate. True believers may stumble, backslide, and fall under discipline—but they do not finally depart, because God preserves them (John 10:28-29; Philippians 1:6).

**Hebrews 6:4-6**: "For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt."

This describes people who had exposure to and participation in the blessings of the gospel ("enlightened," "tasted," "shared") but who fall away in a final, irreversible manner. The impossibility of restoration is not because God refuses to forgive, but because they will never repent. Their hearts are hardened beyond recovery.

**Hebrews 10:26-27**: "For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries."

The deliberate (ἑκουσίως, *hekousiōs*), persistent rejection of the truth after full knowledge leads not to discipline but to judgment. There is no sacrifice for sins remaining because they have trampled underfoot the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant, and outraged the Spirit of grace (Hebrews 10:29).

**2 Peter 2:20-22**: "For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them. What the true proverb says has happened to them: 'The dog returns to its own vomit, and the sow, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire.'"

The metaphors are telling: dogs and pigs. These were never sheep. They had external knowledge and temporary reformation ("escaped the defilements"), but their nature was never changed. When they return to their sin, they reveal what they always were.

**Characteristics of Apostasy:**
- Departing from the faith and not returning
- Hardening after correction rather than repenting
- Trampling the Son of God underfoot (Hebrews 10:29)
- Showing contempt for the blood of the covenant
- Final, settled rejection of Christ

**Biblical Examples:**
- **Judas Iscariot** (John 6:64, 70-71; Acts 1:25) - Never truly a believer, though he was among the twelve
- **Those who "went out from us"** (1 John 2:19) - Their departure revealed they were never truly of the church
- **Demas**, who loved this present world (2 Timothy 4:10) - Abandoned Paul and the faith
- **Hymenaeus and Alexander**, whom Paul "handed over to Satan" (1 Timothy 1:19-20) - Shipwrecked their faith
- **Those described in Hebrews 6:4-6** - Fell away beyond recovery

**The Finality:**
Apostasy is not backsliding. Backsliders return; apostates do not. Apostasy proves they were never regenerate (1 John 2:19). Apostasy is beyond repentance—not because God won't forgive, but because they will never repent. Their consciences are seared (1 Timothy 4:2), their hearts hardened (Hebrews 3:12-13), and they are given over to delusion (2 Thessalonians 2:11-12).

### Additional Categories

**The False Teacher (2 Peter 2; Jude; 2 Timothy 3:1-9)**

False teachers may overlap with apostates but deserve separate treatment because of their destructive influence on others.

**Characteristics:**
- **Denying the Master** who bought them (2 Peter 2:1)
- **Creeping in unnoticed** (Jude 4), infiltrating the church deceptively
- **Having a form of godliness** but denying its power (2 Timothy 3:5)
- **Leading others astray** (2 Peter 2:2; 2 Timothy 3:6)
- **Greed and sensuality** as motives (2 Peter 2:3, 14)

**Pastoral Response:**
- **Mark them** (Romans 16:17) - publicly identify them as dangerous
- **Avoid them** (2 Timothy 3:5) - have no partnership with them
- **Warn the flock** (Acts 20:29-31) - protect the sheep from wolves
- **Do not receive them** (2 John 10-11) - refuse them platform or greeting

**May Never Have Been Genuine:**
Peter and Jude both describe false teachers in terms suggesting they were never truly saved. They are "waterless springs" (2 Peter 2:17), "wandering stars" (Jude 13), and "irrational animals" (2 Peter 2:12). These are not fallen saints but wolves who infiltrated the flock.

**The Backslider (Distinct from Apostate)**

The backslider is a true believer who wanders from the faith temporarily but will ultimately return because God preserves His own.

**Biblical Examples:**
- **Peter's denial** of Christ (Luke 22:54-62) - Fell grievously, wept bitterly, was restored (John 21:15-19)
- **David's adultery and murder** (2 Samuel 11-12) - Fell into terrible sin, was confronted by Nathan, repented (Psalm 51), was restored
- **The Prodigal Son** (Luke 15:11-32) - Wandered into rebellion and ruin, but came to himself and returned

**Key Distinction:**
Backsliders *will* return because they are kept by God's power (John 10:28-29; Philippians 1:6; 1 Peter 1:5). Apostates *will not* return because they were never His sheep.

**Pastoral Response:**
- **Pursue them** as the father pursued the prodigal (in prayer and appeal)
- **Pray for them** earnestly, knowing God is able to restore
- **Restore them when they return** with joy and without condemnation (Galatians 6:1; James 5:19-20)

### Summary Framework

| Stage | Category | Church's Action | Expectation |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Immature Christian | Discipleship, patience | Growth over time |
| 2 | Brother in Sin | Private confrontation | Immediate repentance |
| 3 | Formal Discipline | Matthew 18 process (or immediate for public sin) | Repentance or exclusion |
| 4 | Divisive Person | Two warnings, then rejection | Cessation of division or departure |
| 5 | Anathema | Formal exclusion, delivery to Satan | Hope for repentance, but uncertain |
| 6 | Apostasy | Discernment, not declaration | Final departure reveals they were never saved |

**The Church's Authority:**
- We can and must declare someone under discipline (Matthew 18:17)
- We can and must pronounce anathema when Scripture requires (Galatians 1:8-9; 1 Corinthians 5:5)
- We cannot infallibly declare someone eternally lost (only God knows the heart)
- We *can* recognize the marks of apostasy and respond accordingly (treat as unbeliever, warn others, refuse fellowship)

**The Goal:**
In every stage except apostasy, the goal is restoration. Even anathema is pronounced with the hope "that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord" (1 Corinthians 5:5). We discipline because we love, and we love because Christ first loved us.

## On Ignorance, Sincerity, and Response to Truth

Scripture distinguishes between ignorant error and willful rebellion, but neither ignorance nor sincerity excuses falsehood. God is merciful to the humble and teachable, but He is just toward those who resist truth when it is presented.

### Ignorance Is Not Innocence

Paul "received mercy" because he acted "ignorantly in unbelief" (1 Timothy 1:13), not because ignorance was safe, but because he repented when confronted with truth. Likewise, Peter says, "You acted in ignorance," then immediately calls his hearers to repentance (Acts 3:17-19). Ignorance may mitigate immediate guilt, but it does not eliminate the need for correction and change.

The person who is genuinely ignorant—who has never heard the truth, or who has been poorly taught—is in a different position than the person who has been confronted with truth and refuses it. But even ignorance does not excuse sin. It simply means that judgment will be according to knowledge (Luke 12:47-48). The one who did not know will still be judged, though less severely than the one who knew and disobeyed.

### Sincerity Is Not Safety

Uzzah sincerely tried to steady the ark but was struck dead (2 Samuel 6:6-7). Saul offered an unlawful sacrifice in panic and lost the kingdom (1 Samuel 13:11-13). Sincerity without submission is still disobedience. The issue is not the temperature of our devotion, but the object and manner of it.

Many false teachers are sincere. Many cultists are sincere. Many apostates were once sincere. Sincerity proves nothing except that a person believes what they are saying. It does not prove that what they believe is true.

### True Sincerity Yields to Truth

Apollos was corrected by Priscilla and Aquila and became a faithful gospel preacher (Acts 18:26). The Bereans verified Paul's message with Scripture and were commended for it (Acts 17:11). Peter took Paul's public rebuke without division (Galatians 2:11-14). These examples show what genuine humility looks like: it listens, learns, and changes.

The mark of true sincerity is not how strongly you hold a belief, but how quickly you release it when shown from Scripture that it is wrong. Pride clings to error. Humility releases it.

### False Sincerity Masks Rebellion

The Pharisees claimed sight, and were judged more severely for it (John 9:41). Hebrews warns of those who sin after receiving knowledge (Hebrews 10:26-27). God rebukes not only error, but the refusal to be corrected. The mark of a hardened heart is not the presence of error, but the resistance to correction.

This is why Jesus said that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven (Matthew 12:31-32). It is not that there is some magical sin beyond the reach of the cross. It is that blasphemy against the Spirit is the settled, final rejection of the truth. It is not ignorance—it is willful, informed rebellion. And when a person reaches that point, they have placed themselves beyond mercy, not because God is unwilling, but because they are unwilling.

### The Test of Regeneration

The true mark of regeneration is a humble response to truth. To resist correction, defend error, or hide behind feelings is not sanctification—it is self-deception. As James 1:22 says, *"Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves."*

If you claim to love God but refuse to submit to His Word, you are lying—either to yourself or to others. If you claim to follow Christ but live in unrepentant sin, you are deceived. The test of life is not what you profess with your mouth, but how you respond when confronted with truth.

### What Must Be Rejected

- That sincerity sanctifies disobedience
- That ignorance is a refuge from judgment if it persists
- That emotional conviction is equal to spiritual submission
- That truth is determined by subjective experience or personal impressions

### What Must Be Affirmed

- That teachability and repentance are marks of saving grace
- That error, when exposed, must be repented of—not rebranded
- That correction is a mercy, not a threat
- That God is patient toward the humble but opposes the proud (James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:5)

## On Biblical Love and the Counterfeit "Being Loving"

True love is covenantal allegiance to Christ, expressed in both heart and deed, inseparable from obedience to His Word (John 14:15; 1 Corinthians 13:4-6). Love may be imperfect, but it cannot be counterfeit. Anything less than covenantal fidelity is not a weaker form of love—it is no love at all.

### What Biblical Love Is

**Love is the fruit of the Spirit**, not mere civility or sentiment (Galatians 5:22; Romans 5:5). It is supernatural in origin and character. You cannot manufacture biblical love through effort or good intentions. It is the result of the Spirit's work in a regenerate heart.

**Biblical love is transparent, truthful, and rejoices in righteousness** (1 Corinthians 13:6). It does not conceal, manipulate, or affirm sin. Love speaks the truth, even when the truth is hard. It confronts, corrects, and calls to repentance—not because it is harsh, but because it cares about the eternal destiny of the beloved.

**God's covenant love (ḥesed) is steadfast, electing, and transformative** (Deuteronomy 7:6-8; Romans 5:8). It is not generic goodwill but a committed, purposeful devotion. God does not love everyone in the same way. He loves His elect with a saving, transforming love that He does not extend to the reprobate. This is not cruelty—it is covenant faithfulness.

**True love disciplines and redeems but never deceives** (Hebrews 12:6). Discipline is proof of love, not evidence against it. A father who refuses to discipline his son does not love him—he hates him (Proverbs 13:24). God disciplines those He loves because He is committed to their holiness, not merely their happiness.

**The command to love even enemies is binding and non-optional** for all who belong to Christ (Matthew 5:44; Romans 12:20). This does not mean affirming their sin, but seeking their good—which always includes truth. To love an enemy means to pray for his salvation, to bless him when he curses, and to speak truth to him even when he hates you for it.

**What biblical love looks like in practice:**
- **Jonathan's covenant love for David** (1 Samuel 18:1-4; 20:17) - Sacrificial, loyal, even at personal cost
- **Ruth's covenant love for Naomi** (Ruth 1:16-17) - "Where you go I will go; your God shall be my God"
- **Paul's fatherly love for Timothy** (1 Timothy 1:2; 2 Timothy 1:4) - Mentoring, correcting, affirming
- **Christ's love demonstrated** (John 15:13; Romans 5:8) - Laying down life for friends while we were yet sinners

### What Biblical Love Is Not

"Being loving" does not mean affirming sin in the name of kindness. To call evil good is hatred, not love (Isaiah 5:20). The person who affirms a sinner in his rebellion does not love that sinner—he hates him. He values his own reputation and comfort more than the sinner's soul.

Civility or silence in the face of sin do not constitute biblical love. Niceness is not a fruit of the Spirit. Politeness is not the same as godliness. You can be the nicest person in the world and still be on your way to hell—and you can take others with you by refusing to warn them.

Outward performance while harboring inward contempt is not acceptable before God (Matthew 23:25-27). Jesus called this hypocrisy, and it is damnable. You cannot claim to love someone while secretly despising them. You cannot claim to serve God while harboring bitterness and unforgiveness in your heart. God sees through the mask, and He will judge accordingly.

God's covenant love is not indiscriminate or identical toward all people (Romans 8:29; Deuteronomy 7:7-8). God loves His elect with a saving, transforming love distinct from His common kindness to all. He sends rain on the just and the unjust (Matthew 5:45), but He does not save them both. Election is real, and God's love is particular.

God does not love sinners "just as they are" without transformation. This severs love from holiness and makes grace mere tolerance. God loves sinners enough to save them *from* their sin, not to leave them *in* it. To preach a love that does not call for repentance is to preach a false gospel.

### The Sentimental Distortion of Love

The modern church has redefined love as passive affirmation, emotional validation, or therapeutic encouragement. This is not the love of Christ. Christ's love confronts (Revelation 3:19), corrects (Hebrews 12:6), and calls to repentance (Luke 13:3). His love is costly—it cost Him His life. And it demands everything from us in return.

Sentimental love says, "I accept you just as you are." Biblical love says, "I love you too much to leave you as you are." Sentimental love avoids conflict. Biblical love pursues truth, even when it hurts. Sentimental love prizes feelings. Biblical love prizes holiness.

### The Delusion of Duplicity

The counterfeit religion of duplicity—keeping the peace outwardly while harboring contempt or unbelief inwardly—is what Christ condemned as whitewashed tombs (Matthew 23:27). Hypocrisy is not love. Tolerance is not love. Love is covenantal fidelity, aligned in heart and deed, never divided or duplicitous. It comforts the broken, confronts the rebellious, and endures in truth.

This is perhaps the greatest deception of our age: the belief that you can "love" someone while refusing to tell them the truth. The belief that you can smile at someone, affirm them, and remain silent about their sin—and call that love. This is not love. It is cowardice dressed in religious language.

### On Romanticizing the Greek Love Words

The common fallacy that biblical love can be reduced to four neat Greek categories (agapē, phileō, storgē, eros) must be rejected. This romanticized taxonomy imports sentimentality and false distinctions, flattening love into human categories. The apostolic witness defines love not by lexicons, but by Christ's covenant and the cross (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 13).

Modern preaching loves to draw distinctions between different "kinds" of love, as if the Greek words themselves carry inherent theological freight. But this is linguistic eisegesis, not exegesis. The meaning of words is determined by context, not etymology.

### Crushing the Myth of Agapē-ism

The sentimental claim that agapē always signifies holy, God-like love is a myth that cannot survive scrutiny of actual usage. The Septuagint uses ἀγαπάω (*agapaō*) to describe Amnon's incestuous lust for his sister Tamar (2 Samuel 13:15, LXX), which quickly turned to hatred. Jesus Himself uses ἀγαπάω (*agapaō*) and φιλέω (*phileō*) interchangeably in John 21:15-17 when questioning Peter, demonstrating these are not distinct categories of love but synonyms in context. BDAG and other standard lexicons do not support inherent theological distinctions based on the root alone—context, object, and manner determine the quality of love, not the vocabulary choice.

The meaning of love is not secured by Greek vocabulary studies, but by God's covenant and Christ's commands (1 Corinthians 13; John 13:34-35). Any system that romanticizes agapē as inherently divine while dismissing other love-words as inferior is linguistic idolatry, not exegesis.

## On Backsliding, Apostasy, and Heart Posture

Scripture distinguishes between a true believer who backslides into sin or error, and an apostate who departs willfully from the gospel. Both may outwardly appear the same, but are revealed by their response to rebuke.

### The Backslider Stumbles, But Returns

David repented deeply (Psalm 51). Peter denied Christ, but wept bitterly and was restored (Luke 22:62). The Corinthian church repented after severe rebuke (2 Corinthians 7:10-11). These were not apostates, but sons under discipline. The mark of a true believer is not perfection, but a pattern of repentance.

Backsliding is real. Christians sin. Sometimes gravely. David committed adultery and murder. Peter denied Christ three times. The Corinthians were tolerating sexual immorality that even pagans found shocking. But in each case, the response to correction revealed the state of the heart. David broke. Peter wept. The Corinthians repented. This is what regeneration looks like.

### The Apostate Defends Rebellion

Apostasy is not ignorance or weakness. It is a hardened rejection of Christ and resistance to correction (Hebrews 6:4-6; 10:29). Apostates are not confused—they are committed to their own way. As 1 John 2:19 says, *"They went out from us, because they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us."*

The apostate does not stumble and rise. He walks away and does not look back. He does not weep over his sin—he justifies it. He does not tremble at correction—he resents it. He may have been in the church, participated in worship, even held office. But he was never *of* the church. His departure simply revealed what was always true: he never belonged to Christ.

### Heart Posture Is the Dividing Line

Even doctrinally sound people can be lost (Matthew 7:22-23). Even doctrinally confused people can be saved (1 Corinthians 15:1-2; 11:17-22). The difference is this: how do they respond when confronted by truth? Do they tremble at God's Word (Isaiah 66:2), or do they harden their hearts against it?

This is why doctrinal correctness alone is not proof of salvation. The demons have perfect theology—they know exactly who Jesus is (James 2:19). But they do not love Him. They do not submit to Him. They do not worship Him. Knowledge without submission is damnation, not salvation.

Visible fruit, doctrinal alignment, and ministry activity are not infallible signs of regeneration. A soft, trembling heart before God's Word is the only reliable proof.

### What Must Be Rejected

- That apostasy is simply advanced backsliding
- That doctrinal error alone defines a person's standing
- That fruit, gifting, or service guarantees salvation
- That love for "God" excuses denial of the God of Scripture

### What Must Be Affirmed

- That Christ keeps His sheep, even when they stumble (John 10:28-29)
- That apostasy proves a heart never truly regenerated (1 John 2:19)
- That self-deception is real, and observable (James 1:22-24)
- That the test of life is not just doctrine, but repentance (1 John 1:9)

## On False Humility, False Unity, and Gospel Compromise

Biblical unity is grounded in truth, not sentiment. There is no unity apart from submission to the Word of God. Humility is not the suspension of conviction—it is submission to divine revelation.

### True Unity Is Built on Doctrine

Christ broke down the wall between Jew and Gentile through the cross (Ephesians 2:14), not through relational tone or compromise. Apostolic unity was fiercely guarded by sharp correction and clear boundaries (Galatians 2:11-14; Romans 16:17). Unity is not the absence of conflict—it is the presence of shared submission to truth.

The modern ecumenical movement has inverted this. It seeks unity first and truth second. It prioritizes relationships over righteousness. It values cooperation over correction. This is not biblical unity—it is pragmatic alliance. And it will not stand the test of fire.

### False Humility Fears Man, Not God

Calls to "tone down" theological clarity in the name of humility are often cloaked pride—the kind that seeks human affirmation over divine approval. True humility bows to God's Word even when it costs relationships, reputation, or comfort (Acts 5:29).

False humility says, "Who am I to judge?" Biblical humility says, "Who am I to ignore what God has said?" False humility is silent in the face of error. Biblical humility speaks truth with trembling. False humility values peace at any cost. Biblical humility values truth above all.

**What true humility looks like in practice:**
- **Christ's humility** (Philippians 2:5-8) - Not grasping equality with God, taking form of servant
- **Moses** receiving correction from Jethro (Exodus 18:24) - "Moses listened to his father-in-law"
- **Apollos** receiving instruction from Priscilla and Aquila (Acts 18:26)
- **The Bereans** testing Paul's teaching against Scripture (Acts 17:11) - Noble because they verified truth
- **Peter** accepting Paul's public rebuke (Galatians 2:11-14; no record of division resulting)

### Compromise Is Not Peace

To leave false teaching unchecked in the name of "theological balance" is not gentleness—it is disobedience. Truth does not divide the church. Sin and error do. Jesus Himself said, *"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword"* (Matthew 10:34). The sword is His Word, and it cuts between truth and error.

Every generation wants to soften this. Every generation wants to believe that if we just emphasize love, avoid controversy, and focus on what unites us, we can have unity without division. But this is a lie. There is no unity with those who deny the gospel. There is no fellowship with those who worship a false god. To pursue unity at the expense of truth is to abandon both.

### Emotional Framing Has No Place in Determining Priority

Emotional framing and selective emphasis have no place in determining doctrinal priority. God's commands are not negotiable. Systematized disobedience—whether in church governance, soteriology, or created order—is not a "secondary issue." It is rebellion. The seriousness of an issue is not determined by how it makes us feel, but by what God has said about it.

This is the great deception of our age: the belief that tone trumps truth, that feelings determine facts, that emotional appeals can override divine commands. But God is not swayed by our tears. He is not moved by our protests. He does not adjust His Word to accommodate our preferences. His Word stands forever, and we must bow to it—or be broken by it.

### What Must Be Rejected

- That humility demands restraint when Scripture speaks clearly
- That relational tone trumps doctrinal truth
- That unity is preserved by avoiding hard lines
- That theological clarity is arrogance

### What Must Be Affirmed

- That loving correction is a mark of true unity (Galatians 6:1; Ephesians 4:15)
- That false teachers must be rebuked, not platformed (Titus 1:13; 2 Timothy 4:2)
- That biblical clarity must never be sacrificed to preserve alliances
- That real peace only flows from truth (John 14:27)

## On Schism, Separation, and Ecclesiastical Fellowship

The unity of the Spirit is a sacred trust to be guarded through peace and doctrinal fidelity (Ephesians 4:3). Therefore, the church must have clear biblical convictions regarding its relationships with other professing bodies.

### On Schism and Lawful Separation

**Schism**—the act of creating division within the body of Christ over secondary matters, personal ambition, or offenses—is a sin condemned by Scripture (Romans 16:17; 1 Corinthians 1:10). Paul rebuked the Corinthians for forming factions around personalities rather than remaining united in Christ. Schism is the sin of dividing the church over matters that do not warrant division.

However, **lawful separation** is not only permissible but biblically required when a church or denomination formally embraces heresy, tolerates gross and unrepentant sin, or abandons the marks of a true church (the right preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, and right practice of discipline). To remain in fellowship with such a body is not faithfulness but compromise, violating the command to "come out from among them" (2 Corinthians 6:17; Revelation 18:4).

The difference between schism and separation is the difference between dividing over preferences and dividing over principles. The former is sin; the latter is obedience. The former is rooted in pride; the latter in holiness. The former creates unnecessary division; the latter preserves necessary purity.

### On Ecclesiastical Fellowship and Cooperation

Spiritual fellowship and cooperative ministry are only possible where there is a shared commitment to the primary doctrines of the Christian faith, especially the gospel of salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, and the authority of Scripture.

Organizational unity cannot exist where doctrinal unity is absent (Amos 3:3). Therefore, partnership in ministry, pulpit sharing, and financial support must be withheld from individuals, churches, or organizations that deny primary doctrines as defined in this framework.

This is not sectarianism. This is discernment. It is not unloving to refuse partnership with those who deny the gospel. It is faithful. It is not arrogant to draw doctrinal lines. It is obedient.

While we pray for and show Christian charity to all who name the name of Christ, formal partnership requires a shared foundation of truth. You can be kind to someone without platforming them. You can pray for someone without partnering with them. You can love someone without affirming their error.

### What Must Be Rejected

**Sectarianism**, which refuses fellowship with genuine churches of Christ over disagreements on secondary doctrines. This is the error of those who make baptism mode, eschatology, or church government into tests of orthodoxy. These matters are important, but they do not determine whether someone is a Christian.

**Pragmatic or sentimental ecumenism**, which sacrifices doctrinal clarity for the sake of missional strategy, social action, or superficial unity. True unity is a fruit of the truth, not a substitute for it. The modern evangelical movement has pursued unity at the expense of truth for decades, and the result is a church that stands for nothing and falls for everything.

### What Must Be Affirmed

- That separation from error is not unloving—it is obedience (2 John 10-11)
- That doctrinal clarity serves mission, not hinders it (1 Timothy 4:16)
- That the marks of a true church are non-negotiable
- That partnership requires more than sentiment—it requires shared submission to Scripture

---

## What Must Be Rejected

### 1. Reclassifying Clear Commands as Secondary

All attempts to reclassify clear commands of Scripture as secondary to preserve superficial unity must be rejected. This is often done in the name of "majoring on the majors," but it functionally silences God on issues He has spoken clearly about. When Scripture is explicit, we have no authority to declare it negotiable.

God's created order for men and women, marriage and sexuality, the nature of the church, and the requirements of holiness are not secondary matters. They are tied to creation order, the nature of God's design, and the gospel itself. To treat them as negotiable is not humility—it is rebellion.

### 2. Antinomianism Disguised as Grace

The modern notion that grace removes obligation is antinomianism, not gospel freedom (Jude 4). Grace does not nullify the law—it writes it on our hearts (Jeremiah 31:33; Romans 8:4). Obedience is the fruit of saving faith, not a threat to it.

Jesus said, *"If you love me, you will keep my commandments"* (John 14:15). This is not legalism. It is the definition of discipleship. Those who claim to love Christ but live in habitual, unrepentant disobedience are deceived (1 John 2:4).

### 3. Calling Clarity "Sectarian"

The cowardice that calls clarity "sectarian" when Scripture calls it fidelity must be rejected (Romans 16:17; 2 John 10-11). The world—and increasingly, the church—demands that we hold convictions loosely. But God demands that we hold His Word firmly.

To have clear doctrinal convictions is not arrogance. It is submission to revelation. To refuse to take a stand on what God has said is not humility—it is disobedience disguised as niceness.

### 4. Emotional Appeals That Pit Obedience Against Compassion

True compassion speaks the truth (Ephesians 4:15). Emotional appeals that reframe biblical clarity as "unloving" or "harsh" are manipulative, not merciful. Love does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth (1 Corinthians 13:6).

The most unloving thing you can do is affirm someone in their sin. The most loving thing you can do is tell them the truth—even if it costs you the relationship. This is what Christ did. This is what the apostles did. This is what we are called to do.

### 5. Defining Legalism

Legalism is biblically defined as:
- **Adding to God's commands** what He has not required (Colossians 2:20-23)
- **Binding conscience where God has left it free** (Romans 14:1-4; Galatians 5:1)
- **Making human tradition equal to Scripture** (Mark 7:6-13)
- **Pursuing righteousness through law-keeping rather than faith** (Galatians 3:1-5; Philippians 3:9)

Legalism is not:
- Calling sin what God calls sin
- Maintaining biblical standards for church membership
- Refusing fellowship with those who deny primary doctrine
- Drawing clear doctrinal lines where Scripture draws them

---

## What Must Be Affirmed

### 1. Obedience Is Not Legalism

Obedience to Christ is not legalism—it is faith working through love (Galatians 5:6; John 14:15). Legalism is the attempt to earn God's favor through works. Obedience is the evidence that God's favor has already been freely given.

We do not obey to be saved. We obey because we are saved. And our obedience—imperfect as it is—is the fruit of the Spirit's work in us, not a contribution to our justification.

### 2. Unity Must Be Rooted in Truth

Unity must be rooted in truth, not papered-over differences that misrepresent God or His Word (Amos 3:3). False unity is not unity at all—it is compromise masquerading as peace.

The apostles did not pursue unity at any cost. They guarded the gospel, rebuked error, and drew clear lines. They did this because they loved the church, not because they hated those in error. True unity is the fruit of shared submission to Scripture, not the result of overlooking it.

### 3. Grace Magnifies Accountability

Grace magnifies accountability, not minimizes it (Titus 2:11-12). To whom much is given, much will be required (Luke 12:48). The more clearly we understand the gospel, the more responsible we are to live in light of it.

This is why warning passages exist in Scripture. They are not threats to true believers—they are tests for false professors. If you can live in unrepentant sin and feel no conviction, you should question whether you have truly been born again.

### 4. God's Word Is Fire and Hammer

> *"Is not my word like fire, declares the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?"* (Jeremiah 23:29)

God's Word is not a wax nose to be shaped by human preference. It is a two-edged sword that divides soul and spirit (Hebrews 4:12). It confronts, convicts, and commands. Our task is not to soften it, but to submit to it.

---

## Summary

To violate primary doctrine is to worship a false god or preach a false gospel. To deny secondary doctrine brings disorder, not damnation. To elevate conscience above Scripture is rebellion in disguise. True liberty exists only in humble submission to the Word of God. We are not free to redefine His commands—we are free to obey them from the heart.

---

## Appendix: Modern Doctrinal Misclassifications

This appendix identifies common errors in contemporary evangelicalism where doctrines are systematically misclassified—either elevated beyond their biblical weight or diminished below it—resulting in false unity, doctrinal confusion, or the toleration of serious error. Each entry identifies the doctrine, the common misclassification, the correct classification, the violation of the framework, and why it matters.

---

### 1. God's Created Order for Men and Women

**Common Classification**: Secondary or Conscience  
**Correct Classification**: Primary (Salvific and Worship-Defining) when persistent and unrepentant  
**Framework Violation**: Violates the **Covenantal Filter** and the principle that doctrines tied to **creation order** and **persistent, unrepentant sin** are always primary.

**Why It Matters**:  
The biblical teaching on God's design for men and women is not a cultural application of general principles—it is grounded in God's creational design of male and female in His image (Genesis 1:27), the relational order established at creation (1 Timothy 2:12-13), and the covenant structure of marriage as a picture of Christ and the church (Ephesians 5:22-33). Scripture consistently grounds these truths in creation, not culture, which places them under the authority of God's unchanging design.

Paul is clear that persistent violations of God's created order exclude from the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). This is not a matter of conscience or secondary application. It is a matter of salvation, worship, and the nature of holiness.

To classify issues tied to God's created order as secondary is to treat persistent, unrepentant sin as negotiable. This violates the **Posture Clause**: willful, corrected-yet-unrepentant disobedience transforms any issue into a primary concern. When someone is shown the clear teaching of Scripture on God's design and refuses to submit, they are not merely in error on a secondary matter—they are in rebellion against God's revealed will.

**The Posture Test**: A person who holds confused views out of ignorance or poor teaching may still be regenerate. But once corrected with Scripture and they refuse to submit, defending their position as acceptable before God, **the issue becomes primary salvifically** because the heart posture is now rebellion, not confusion.

---

### 2. Women in Church Office (Eldership/Pastoral Teaching)

**Common Classification**: Secondary or Conscience  
**Correct Classification**: Secondary Salvifically (in cases of ignorance), but **Primary Salvifically when persistently defended after correction**; Primary Ecclesially in all cases  
**Framework Violation**: Violates **Dual-Level Clarity** and the **Posture Clause**—the principle that a doctrine can be secondary for salvation in cases of ignorance but becomes primary when willfully defended, and is always primary for church order and worship.

**Why It Matters**:  
The question of women serving as elders or exercising authoritative teaching over men in the gathered assembly is not a matter of cultural preference or spiritual gifting—it is a matter of **creational order** (1 Timothy 2:12-13) and the **structure of the church** as established by apostolic authority (1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9). Paul grounds his prohibition not in first-century culture, but in the creation account itself: "Adam was formed first, then Eve."

**The Content Test**: At the level of content, this is secondary salvifically for someone genuinely confused or poorly taught. A person who holds to egalitarianism out of ignorance may still be a genuine believer. However, this error cannot be tolerated within a local church's practice without undermining the biblical pattern for worship and leadership. This is **primary ecclesially**—a church must have a coherent, biblical practice.

**The Posture Test**: Once a person is shown the biblical teaching grounded in creation order and they refuse to submit, **the issue becomes primary salvifically** because the heart posture is now rebellion, not confusion. Persistent defense of women in eldership after clear scriptural correction is defiance against God's ordained structure for His church.

**For Churches**: A church that institutionalizes women in eldership is not merely wrong on ecclesiology—it is encoding defiance into its worship structure. This is **primary salvific error** because it represents systematic, corporate rebellion against God's revealed order. Such a church has made egalitarianism a functional doctrine that governs its practice, which elevates it to a matter of worship and therefore a matter of faithfulness to God.

---

### 3. Justification by Faith Alone

**Common Classification**: Sometimes treated as secondary in ecumenical dialogues (e.g., modern evangelical-Catholic statements)  
**Correct Classification**: Primary (Gospel-Defining)  
**Framework Violation**: Direct violation of the principle that **denying a primary doctrine results in preaching a false gospel** (Galatians 1:8-9).

**Why It Matters**:  
Justification by faith alone is the article upon which the church stands or falls. To compromise on this doctrine—whether by adding works as a co-instrument of justification, by affirming baptismal regeneration as necessary for salvation, or by treating Rome's Council of Trent as anything less than anathema—is to preach another gospel.

Modern attempts to downgrade this to a "secondary" issue in the name of unity with Roman Catholicism are not humility—they are betrayal. Paul did not treat the Judaizers' insistence on circumcision as a secondary matter. He pronounced a curse on anyone who preached a gospel that added works to faith (Galatians 1:8-9). The Reformation was not a tragic misunderstanding—it was a necessary defense of the gospel itself.

---

### 4. Theonomy / Mosaic Civil Law in the New Covenant

**Common Classification**: Sometimes elevated to Primary; often treated as safely Secondary  
**Correct Classification**: Serious doctrinal error that violates the Covenantal Filter; can become Primary Salvifically when defended after correction  
**Framework Violation**: Violates the **Covenantal Filter**—the safeguard that Old Covenant civil laws apply only through the fulfillment and reinterpretation of the New Covenant.

**Why It Matters**:  
Theonomy—the belief that the Mosaic civil law should be enforced by modern civil governments—errs by failing to recognize the **categorical distinction** between Israel as a theocratic nation under the old covenant and the church under the new covenant. The civil laws given to Israel were tied to her unique role as a covenant nation, a role that has been fulfilled in Christ and does not transfer to Gentile nations or the church.

This is not to say that God's moral law (summarized in the Ten Commandments and affirmed throughout the New Testament) is irrelevant. It remains binding. But the **civil penalties** prescribed in the Mosaic law (e.g., stoning for Sabbath-breaking, execution for adultery) were tied to Israel's specific covenant administration and do not bind the nations today.

**The Danger**: Theonomy is not a benign secondary disagreement. It is a **serious covenantal distortion** that threatens both the law-gospel distinction and covenant theology. It often binds consciences where Scripture leaves them free and can functionally reintroduce works-righteousness by treating the Mosaic code as normative for new covenant believers.

**The Content Test**: Many theonomists still affirm justification by faith alone and the sufficiency of Christ's work. For these individuals, theonomy may be serious error without being damnable heresy. They are wrong about the application of the law, but they may still hold the gospel.

**The Posture Test**: When theonomy is defended after biblical correction—especially when it functionally introduces works into standing with God, binds consciences as if the old covenant civil code were normative, or treats disagreement as unfaithfulness to God's law—**it becomes primary salvifically** because the system now threatens the gospel itself.

**For Churches**: Churches that enforce theonomy as a rule of faith and fellowship, requiring adherence to Mosaic civil penalties as a matter of orthodoxy, have made it a primary issue. Such institutionalization moves theonomy from serious error into the realm of binding consciences unlawfully and distorting the covenants.

---

### 5. Eschatology (Amillennialism, Premillennialism, Postmillennialism)

**Common Classification**: Secondary  
**Correct Classification**: Secondary (unless it results in Gospel Distortion)  
**Framework Violation**: Becomes Primary if it denies **final judgment**, the **bodily return of Christ**, or affirms **full preterism** (the belief that all prophecy, including the resurrection and final judgment, was fulfilled in AD 70).

**Why It Matters**:  
The Bible permits legitimate diversity in eschatological frameworks. Amillennialists, historic premillennialists, and postmillennialists all affirm the essential gospel realities: Christ will return bodily, the dead will be raised, the final judgment will occur, and the eternal state will be established. Disagreement on the timing and nature of the millennium does not undermine these core truths.

However, when eschatology is used to **deny the future, bodily return of Christ**, to **redefine the resurrection as purely spiritual**, or to **eliminate final judgment**, it ceases to be a secondary matter. Full preterism (also called "hyper-preterism") is not an acceptable eschatological variant—it is a denial of core Christian doctrine. The same is true of any eschatology that functionally denies the resurrection of the body or the final, visible return of Christ.

**The Posture Test**: If someone is corrected with Scripture showing that Christ's return, the resurrection, and final judgment are future, bodily, and universal, and they persist in denying these truths, **the issue becomes primary salvifically**.

---

### 6. Mode and Subjects of Baptism

**Common Classification**: Secondary  
**Correct Classification**: Secondary (Ecclesially Important, Not Salvific—unless tied to justification)  
**Framework Violation**: None when properly understood; becomes Primary if tied to regeneration or justification and defended after correction.

**Why It Matters**:  
Baptism is a divinely instituted ordinance, and disagreement over its proper mode (immersion vs. sprinkling) and subjects (believers only vs. covenant children) has historically resulted in denominational distinctions. However, Scripture does not tie one's eternal salvation to holding the correct view of baptism's administration, provided one affirms that:
- Baptism is a command of Christ (Matthew 28:19)
- It signifies union with Christ in His death and resurrection (Romans 6:3-4)
- It is distinct from and does not accomplish regeneration (contra baptismal regeneration)

Baptists and Paedobaptists (those who baptize infants) can recognize each other as genuine Christians, even while maintaining that the other is wrong on this issue. The **Dual-Level Clarity** principle applies here: baptism is secondary *salvifically* (you can be wrong about it and still be saved), but it is primary *ecclesially* (a local church must have a coherent, biblical practice and cannot baptize infants on Sundays and believers only on Wednesdays).

**When It Becomes Primary**: The error occurs when groups elevate baptism to a salvific necessity (as in Roman Catholicism, certain streams of the Church of Christ, or Eastern Orthodoxy), making it a means of justification rather than a sign and seal of the covenant. When someone is shown that baptism does not regenerate or justify and they persist in teaching that it does, **this becomes primary salvifically** because it distorts the gospel itself.

---

### 7. Universalism (The Belief That All Will Be Saved)

**Common Classification**: Sometimes treated as a "hopeful" theological variant  
**Correct Classification**: Primary (Heresy—Denies the Gospel and Final Judgment)  
**Framework Violation**: Direct denial of **primary doctrine**—specifically, the doctrines of hell, final judgment, and the exclusivity of salvation through Christ alone.

**Why It Matters**:  
Universalism is not a secondary issue or an area of theological exploration. It is a denial of core Christian doctrine. Scripture is unambiguous:
- There is a final judgment (Revelation 20:11-15)
- Not all will be saved (Matthew 7:13-14; 25:31-46)
- Hell is eternal, conscious punishment (Matthew 25:46; Revelation 14:11)
- Salvation is only through faith in Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12)

Universalism denies all of this. It redefines the gospel as God's universal love without His justice, Christ's work as a universal reconciliation rather than a particular atonement, and hell as either temporary or nonexistent. This is not a variant of Christian theology—it is a departure from it.

**The Posture Clause**: Even if someone arrives at universalism out of emotional concern for the lost, once they are shown that Scripture teaches the reality of eternal punishment and they refuse to submit, they have moved from ignorant error into willful rebellion. At that point, they are not holding a secondary view—they are denying a primary doctrine of the faith.

---

### 8. Prosperity Gospel / Word of Faith Movement

**Common Classification**: Sometimes tolerated as "excessive" or "imbalanced" but not outright heretical  
**Correct Classification**: Primary (False Gospel)  
**Framework Violation**: Violates the principle that **redefining the gospel or the nature of faith constitutes heresy**, not mere doctrinal imbalance.

**Why It Matters**:  
The prosperity gospel is not Christianity with an emphasis problem—it is a different religion. It teaches that:
- Faith is a force that manipulates God into giving health and wealth
- Jesus's atonement secures not only spiritual salvation but guaranteed physical healing and financial prosperity
- Suffering, poverty, and sickness are signs of insufficient faith

This is a denial of the biblical gospel, which calls us to take up our cross, promises tribulation in this world (John 16:33), and teaches that godliness with contentment is great gain (1 Timothy 6:6). The prosperity gospel redefines faith (from trust in Christ to a formula for manipulating God), Christ's work (from sin-bearing substitute to health-and-wealth provider), and the Christian life (from self-denial to self-fulfillment).

Paul pronounces anathema on anyone who preaches a different gospel (Galatians 1:8-9). The prosperity gospel qualifies. It must not be tolerated as a secondary issue or treated as a matter of emphasis. It is a soul-destroying lie that must be exposed and rejected.

### 9. Young Earth Creationism as Gospel Issue

**Common Classification**: Primary (in certain circles)  
**Correct Classification**: Secondary  
**Framework Violation**: Elevates a disputable matter of timing to salvific status; confuses creation *that* with creation *when*

**Why It Matters**:  
That God created all things ex nihilo is primary doctrine (Genesis 1:1; John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:16; Hebrews 11:3). Denying God as Creator is denial of His sovereignty and a different god entirely. However, the *age* of the earth and the *timeframe* of creation are matters where godly, Bible-believing Christians have differed based on interpretation of Genesis 1-2, the genealogies, and scientific evidence.

Young Earth Creationism may be the correct interpretation (and has strong biblical arguments), but to make it a test of orthodoxy or gospel fidelity violates the framework. Old Earth Creationists who affirm God's direct creative acts, the historicity of Adam and Eve, the fall, and the special creation of humanity in God's image hold to the essential doctrines.

**When it becomes primary:** If someone denies God as Creator, affirms naturalistic evolution that excludes divine agency, or denies the historical Adam (which impacts the doctrine of original sin and Christ as second Adam), these move into primary territory.

### 10. KJV-Onlyism

**Common Classification**: Secondary or Conscience (in some circles)  
**Correct Classification**: Serious Error; becomes Primary when it denies preservation in other texts  
**Framework Violation**: Elevates a particular translation to the level of inspired text; functionally denies God's preservation of His Word in the manuscripts

**Why It Matters**:  
The doctrine of preservation teaches that God has preserved His Word through the manuscript tradition, not through a single English translation made in 1611. KJV-Onlyism (in its strong form) claims that the KJV is the only valid English Bible, that it corrects the Greek and Hebrew, or that it is itself inspired.

This becomes a primary issue when:
- It claims the KJV corrects the original languages (making translation superior to inspiration)
- It denies that God's Word exists in other languages or translations
- It makes salvation or orthodoxy dependent on using a particular English translation
- It binds consciences where God has not bound them

**Moderate forms** that simply prefer the KJV or the Textus Receptus manuscript family are matters of conscience or secondary ecclesial preference, not heresy.

### 11. Teetotalism as Moral Requirement

**Common Classification**: Primary (in certain traditions)  
**Correct Classification**: Conscience  
**Framework Violation**: Makes a personal conviction a binding moral law; confuses drunkenness (prohibited) with drinking (permitted)

**Why It Matters**:  
Scripture consistently condemns drunkenness (Proverbs 20:1; 23:29-35; Ephesians 5:18; Galatians 5:21) but permits moderate consumption of wine (Psalm 104:15; Ecclesiastes 9:7; John 2:1-11; 1 Timothy 5:23). Jesus drank wine (Matthew 11:19) and turned water into wine at Cana.

Some Christians, for reasons of conscience, personal history, or cultural context, choose total abstinence. This is their liberty in Christ and should be respected (Romans 14:21). However, to elevate this personal conviction to a binding moral law, to claim that drinking any alcohol is sin, or to make it a test of spirituality or church membership (beyond pastoral prudence for leaders) is legalism.

**When abstinence is appropriate:**
- In contexts where drinking would cause a weaker brother to stumble (Romans 14:21)
- For those who struggle with addiction
- Where cultural context associates drinking with drunkenness or debauchery
- As a personal vow or discipline

But these are applications of wisdom and love, not binding moral laws for all believers.

### 12. Critical Race Theory / Social Justice as Gospel

**Common Classification**: Secondary or application issue  
**Correct Classification**: Primary when it redefines sin, salvation, or the gospel itself  
**Framework Violation**: Adds social/ethnic categories to spiritual salvation; redefines sin as systemic power rather than rebellion against God

**Why It Matters**:  
The gospel addresses the fundamental problem of sin—human rebellion against God requiring atonement through Christ's substitutionary death (Romans 3:23-26; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4). When social justice frameworks are imported into the church in ways that:
- Redefine sin as primarily systemic oppression rather than personal rebellion against God
- Add racial or social reconciliation to the gospel as necessary for salvation
- Divide people into oppressor/oppressed categories that supersede their identity in Christ
- Make "justice" or "liberation" parallel to or replacement for justification

...they cease to be mere applications of biblical justice principles and become another gospel (Galatians 1:8-9).

**Biblical justice is mandatory:** Care for the poor, opposition to partiality, defending the oppressed (Micah 6:8; James 1:27; 2:1-9). But when justice is redefined through ideological frameworks that contradict Scripture's categories, it becomes a gospel issue.

**The test:** Does the system maintain that the only way to be right with God is through faith in Christ's atoning work alone? Or does it add social, ethnic, or political categories as necessary components of salvation or standing with God?

### 13. The Federal Vision

**Common Classification**: Intramural Reformed debate  
**Correct Classification**: Serious Error; Primary when it denies or redefines justification by faith alone  
**Framework Violation**: Threatens the gospel by redefining election, covenant, and perseverance in ways that can introduce works into justification

**Why It Matters**:  
The Federal Vision is a movement within Reformed theology that redefines certain aspects of covenant theology, election, and justification. At its worst, it:
- Makes justification dependent on covenant faithfulness (not faith alone)
- Defines election as corporate and conditional rather than individual and unconditional
- Teaches that baptism makes one "elect" in a sense that can be lost
- Conflates justification and sanctification

**The Content Test:** Many within the FV movement still affirm justification by faith alone when pressed. For them, this may be serious confusion rather than outright heresy.

**The Posture Test:** When FV theology is defended as compatible with the Reformation's understanding of justification sola fide, and when correction is resisted, it becomes a gospel issue because it functionally introduces works into standing with God.

This is not mere disagreement over covenant theology—it touches the article upon which the church stands or falls.

### 14. Certain Forms of the New Perspective on Paul

**Common Classification**: Academic debate  
**Correct Classification**: Secondary when it concerns background/context; Primary when it denies imputation or sola fide  
**Framework Violation**: Can threaten justification by faith alone depending on which claims are affirmed

**Why It Matters**:  
The "New Perspective on Paul" (NPP) is not monolithic. It includes:
- Historical insights about Second Temple Judaism (often helpful and true)
- Reinterpretation of Paul's critique of "works of law" as ethnic boundary markers rather than legalism
- Denial or redefinition of the imputation of Christ's righteousness
- Redefinition of justification as covenant membership rather than forensic declaration

**What remains secondary:**
- Debates about the precise nature of first-century Judaism
- Whether Paul's primary concern was ethnic division or legalism (it was both)
- Background historical claims that don't alter the gospel

**What becomes primary:**
- Denying the imputation of Christ's active obedience
- Redefining justification so that it no longer means God's forensic declaration of righteousness
- Making justification about covenant membership rather than right standing before God
- Any claim that undermines justification by faith alone through Christ alone

As with FV, the NPP becomes a gospel issue when it distorts or denies the Reformation understanding of justification.

### 15. Arminianism/Synergism

**Common Classification**: Secondary (treated as an acceptable evangelical variant)  
**Correct Classification**: Serious Error; becomes Primary when it results in functional tritheism or denies divine sovereignty  
**Framework Violation**: Can compromise the doctrine of God by positing conflicting divine wills, frustrated divine purposes, and human will as ultimately determinative

**Why It Matters**:  
Arminianism is not monolithic. Some who hold Arminian positions do so out of genuine pastoral concern and may still maintain orthodox views of God's sovereignty, even if inconsistently. However, when Arminian soteriology is pressed to its logical conclusions, it threatens the doctrine of God Himself.

**The Content Test:**
Classic Arminianism affirms:
- Conditional election (based on foreseen faith)
- Universal atonement (Christ died equally for all)
- Resistible grace (the Spirit's work can be finally rejected)
- Possible apostasy (regenerate persons can lose salvation)

These errors primarily concern soteriology and may not necessarily result in worship of a false god if the person still maintains:
- God's ultimate sovereignty over all things
- The unity of the divine will
- That salvation is entirely of grace (even if conditioned on foreseen faith)

**The Posture Test:**
When Arminianism hardens into a system that:
- **Makes human will ultimately sovereign** over divine will in salvation
- **Posits conflicting wills** between Father (wills to save all), Son (dies for all), Spirit (tries to save all), yet most are lost
- **Denies divine omnipotence** by making God's saving purposes defeatable
- **Redefines grace** as divine assistance that enables but doesn't ensure salvation
- **Is defended after biblical correction** showing God's sovereignty in salvation

...it ceases to be a soteriological error and becomes a denial of God's nature. This is functional tritheism (three persons with conflicting purposes) and compromised omnipotence (God's will can be finally thwarted).

**For Churches:**
Churches that institutionalize synergism, making it a test of orthodoxy to deny sovereign grace, have moved beyond secondary error into serious doctrinal compromise that threatens the gospel itself. Such churches may need to be treated as heterodox, not merely as brothers with whom we disagree on secondary matters.

**Pastoral Wisdom:**
Many genuine believers hold Arminian views inconsistently—affirming both human libertarian freedom and God's ultimate sovereignty without recognizing the contradiction. These may be regenerate but confused. The test is: when shown from Scripture that God's will is ultimate, sovereign, and efficacious, do they submit? Or do they harden in defense of human autonomy?

## The Rule That Governs All of This

**Content Test**: Some doctrines are primary by nature because Scripture binds them to God's being, the gospel, creation order, or kingdom exclusion lists.

**Posture Test**: When any doctrine is **knowingly** resisted after clear biblical correction, the matter becomes **primary salvifically** because the issue is now defiance against the Lord, not mere misunderstanding.

Persistent, unrepentant defiance after correction is **always primary salvifically**, regardless of the content-level classification.

## Pastoral Application

This appendix is not meant to foster witch hunts or theological nitpicking. It is meant to train pastors, elders, and mature believers in **doctrinal discernment**. The modern church is awash in confusion because we have lost the ability to distinguish between what matters eternally and what does not.

Use this framework to:
1. **Protect the gospel** by refusing to treat its denial as a secondary issue
2. **Preserve church order** by recognizing that some secondary issues require ecclesial separation even when they don't require personal separation
3. **Promote genuine unity** by not elevating secondary or conscience issues to primary status
4. **Confront error** with clarity, not just kindness—because leaving people in doctrinal confusion is not love

The goal is not to divide unnecessarily, but to **divide rightly** (2 Timothy 2:15)—to separate truth from error, wheat from chaff, and the teaching that accords with godliness from the teaching that undermines it.
