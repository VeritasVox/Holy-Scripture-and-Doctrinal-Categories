## The Holy Scriptures

Holy Scripture is the inspired, inerrant Word of God, breathed out by Him in the original 66 canonical books (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21). God has preserved His Word so that it remains wholly trustworthy and sufficient for faith and life (Isaiah 40:8; Matthew 24:35). The Spirit illumines the hearts of the elect to rightly understand and receive it (1 Corinthians 2:12-14). Thus, Scripture is the final, sufficient, and unbreakable authority over all tradition, experience, and human reason.

### The Supreme Authority

Scripture is the **supreme authority** in the life of the Church, not tradition, experience, or human reasoning. It is sufficient for all matters of doctrine, life, and godliness—including ethics, worship, counseling, and governance. The Reformers recovered this truth under the banner of *sola Scriptura*, not because they despised tradition, but because they recognized that all human tradition must bow before divine revelation.

This does not mean that tradition, reason, or experience have no value. It means they have no *final* authority. They are servants of Scripture, not masters over it. When they align with Scripture, they are useful. When they contradict it, they must be rejected—no matter how ancient, how beloved, or how emotionally compelling they may be.

### The Spirit's Preservation and Illumination

The Holy Spirit **preserves the Word** through providence, ensuring that God's revelation is not lost to history or corrupted beyond recognition. The manuscript evidence for Scripture—particularly the New Testament—is unparalleled in the ancient world. God has not left His people without His Word.

The same Spirit who inspired Scripture **illumines** the minds of believers to rightly interpret and apply it (1 Corinthians 2:10-14). This does not mean that Scripture is unclear or that the Spirit gives private revelations about its meaning. It means that regenerate hearts, indwelt by the Spirit, have the capacity to understand and submit to what God has plainly said. The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit—not because Scripture is obscure, but because his heart is darkened (1 Corinthians 2:14).

### The Closed Canon

No new revelation will be given (Jude 3). The faith has been "once for all delivered to the saints." The canon is closed. All claims of extra-biblical authority—prophecies, visions, or subjective impressions—are **to be tested and rejected if they contradict or bypass Scripture** (Hebrews 1:1-2; Galatians 1:8-9).

This means that any teaching, no matter how compelling or emotionally powerful, that adds to Scripture, contradicts Scripture, or claims equal authority with Scripture is to be rejected. The Spirit never leads contrary to the Word He inspired. To claim that He does is to make God a liar and to accuse Him of contradiction.

### What Must Be Rejected

All teachings that subordinate the authority of Scripture to subjective experiences attributed to the Holy Spirit must be rejected. The modern charismatic movement's elevation of prophecy, visions, and "words from the Lord" above or alongside Scripture is a functional denial of *sola Scriptura*. The Spirit never leads contrary to the Word He inspired, and the canon is closed (2 Peter 1:20-21; Hebrews 1:1-2).

Experience must be tested by Scripture, not the reverse. Feelings must be judged by truth, not the reverse. The moment we allow subjective experience to interpret or override the plain meaning of Scripture, we have abandoned biblical authority and erected an idol in its place.

## The Interpretation of Scripture

Scripture is to be interpreted with fear, not freedom. It is not raw material for spiritual reflection, but divine revelation with fixed meaning—determined by the Spirit-inspired authors and received through reverent exegesis. Interpretation is not creativity; it is submission. The Bible is not a spiritual mirror, a theological sandbox, or a devotional buffet. It is the Word of the living God, and it speaks with objective, binding authority.

### The Meaning of Scripture Is Singular and Knowable

The meaning of Scripture is singular, knowable, and grounded in the author's intent—not in the reader's perspective. God spoke through human authors, and those authors meant something specific. Our task is not to discover what the text means *to us*, but what it meant *to them*—and by extension, what God intended it to mean for all people, in all times, in all places.

This does not mean that Scripture has no application beyond its original context. It means that application must flow from interpretation, not replace it. We do not get to decide what the text means based on how it makes us feel or what would be convenient for our situation. God has spoken. Our job is to listen and obey.

### Proper Interpretation Requires

1. **Pericope-level fidelity** — Every verse must be understood in its immediate literary unit. Context is not optional. A verse plucked from its surrounding passage is a verse divorced from its meaning.

2. **Authorial intent** — What the inspired human writer meant under the Spirit's superintendence is what the text means. The Spirit did not bypass the human authors; He worked through them. To ignore authorial intent is to ignore the means God chose to reveal Himself.

3. **Canonical unity** — Scripture interprets Scripture. God does not contradict Himself. If your interpretation of one passage makes it contradict another, you have misunderstood at least one of them.

4. **Doctrinal coherence** — No meaning is valid if it contradicts God's nature, the gospel, or the moral law. God is holy, just, and good. Any interpretation that makes Him appear otherwise is false.

5. **Covenantal clarity** — The distinction and continuity of Law and Gospel, promise and fulfillment, must be preserved. The Old Testament is not irrelevant, but it must be read through the lens of Christ and the new covenant.

### What Must Be Rejected

All interpretive frameworks that subordinate the plain meaning of Scripture to external authorities must be rejected—whether tradition, ecclesiastical decree, personal experience, mystical impression, cultural mood, or institutional consensus. No pope, council, denomination, confession, or movement has the right to redefine what God has said. The Church is a pillar of the truth, not its architect (1 Timothy 3:15).

The use of "mystery," "tension," or "humility" as theological camouflage to soften hard doctrines, reverse clear commands, or elevate confusion as a virtue must also be rejected. God is not vague. His Word is not a fog. His commands are not open to negotiation.

There are genuine mysteries in Scripture—truths that transcend human comprehension (e.g., the Trinity, the incarnation, divine sovereignty and human responsibility). But these are mysteries *revealed*, not mysteries *concealed*. God has told us what we need to know, and He has done so clearly. The failure to interpret rightly is not due to obscurity in God's Word, but rebellion in man's heart.

### The Seriousness of Interpretation

God has spoken clearly, consistently, and finally. Scripture is not a kaleidoscope of meanings, but a unified revelation of divine truth. To mishandle Scripture is to misrepresent God. To interpret without fear is to speak where angels would tremble.

> *"Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth."* (2 Timothy 2:15)

The stakes are eternal. How we interpret Scripture determines how we understand God, how we proclaim the gospel, and how we live our lives. Carelessness in interpretation is not a minor academic failing—it is spiritual malpractice.

## Doctrinal Categories: Understanding Biblical Priorities

God has spoken with clarity in His Word, and His revelation must be handled with reverence, precision, and submission (Deuteronomy 29:29; Psalm 119:160; 2 Timothy 3:16-17). The church is called to uphold the whole counsel of God (Acts 20:27), not merely salvific minimums. Doctrinal reductionism—the attempt to avoid biblical conflict by flattening theological distinctions—must be rejected.

The categories that follow are not derived from cultural tradition or denominational convenience, but from Scripture's own categories, consequences, and commands. Not all doctrines carry the same weight, and the Bible itself demonstrates this. The question is not whether we will distinguish between doctrines, but whether we will do so biblically.

---

## Primary Doctrine: Salvific and Worship-Defining

A doctrine is primary when its denial results in one or more of the following:

- **Worshiping a false god** (Exodus 20:3; John 4:24)
- **Preaching a false gospel** (Galatians 1:8-9)
- **Violating God's design for the church or His moral law** (1 Timothy 3:15; Hebrews 10:26-31)
- **Persistent disobedience that reflects spiritual rebellion** (1 Corinthians 16:22; Hebrews 3:12-13)

Primary doctrines are rooted in:

- The nature and attributes of God
- The person and work of Jesus Christ
- The person and work of the Holy Spirit
- The created order as affirmed under the New Covenant
- The structure of salvation: election, atonement, regeneration, justification, sanctification, glorification

Scripture never treats these doctrines as optional, situational, or left to personal liberty. They are non-negotiable, and refusal to submit to correction on these truths places one outside the bounds of biblical fellowship.

> *"If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed."* (1 Corinthians 16:22)

> *"They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved."* (2 Thessalonians 2:10)

### Case Examples

**Uzzah touching the ark** (2 Samuel 6:6-7) — God's holiness and prescribed worship were violated, and the consequence was death. Uzzah's intentions may have been sincere, but his action showed contempt for God's command. Sincerity does not excuse disobedience.

**Nadab and Abihu offering unauthorized fire** (Leviticus 10:1-2) — Innovation in worship apart from God's command brought immediate judgment. God had given specific instructions for worship, and they chose to do what seemed right in their own eyes. They died for it.

**Peter's gospel-compromising hypocrisy at Antioch** (Galatians 2:11-14) — Paul confronted Peter publicly because his behavior undermined the truth of the gospel. Peter was not denying the gospel with his words, but his actions were functionally communicating a false gospel. Paul did not allow this to stand.

**Job's friends misrepresenting God** (Job 42:7-9) — God declared that they had not spoken rightly about Him, requiring sacrifice and intercession. They thought they were defending God's honor. Instead, they were bearing false witness against His character. God does not take misrepresentation lightly.

### The Role of Heart Posture

Heart posture matters profoundly. Defiant reinterpretation or refusal to obey transforms secondary errors into primary rebellion. Willful, corrected-yet-unrepentant disobedience is always a gospel issue (Hebrews 10:26-27). As Titus 2:11-12 declares, *"Grace trains us to renounce ungodliness."* Grace is not permission to remain in error—it is power to forsake it.

A person who is merely ignorant or confused but teachable is in a different category than a person who has been shown the truth and chooses to reject it. The former may be a brother in need of instruction. The latter is in danger of proving himself no brother at all.

---

## Secondary Doctrine: Ecclesial and Disciplinary, Not Salvific

A doctrine is secondary when:

- It is taught in Scripture, but not directly tied to salvation or the being of God
- Denial causes disorder or division, but not apostasy
- Scripture addresses it with gravity but permits ongoing fellowship among true believers (Romans 14:1-9; 1 Corinthians 8:1-13)

These doctrines may shape church practice, require denominational distinction, or necessitate practical separation for clarity and order, yet they do not constitute false gospels or idolatry.

### Examples

**Baptism mode** (immersion vs. covenantal inclusion) — Both positions affirm the necessity of baptism and its connection to Christ, but differ on the mode and subjects. Baptists and Presbyterians have maintained separate denominations over this issue for centuries, yet both recognize each other as genuine Christians.

**Eschatology** (amillennial vs. premillennial) — So long as it does not deny key gospel realities such as the bodily return of Christ, final judgment, or resurrection, differences in eschatological frameworks are secondary. The Bible speaks about the end times, but Christians have disagreed on the details without dividing over the gospel.

Secondary doctrines are not indifferent. They affect discipleship, unity, and worship. But disagreement here does not sever covenant standing in Christ. As Romans 14:5 says, *"Let each be fully convinced in his own mind."*

### Warnings on Secondary Matters

Secondary does not mean unimportant. Churches may—and often should—separate over secondary matters for the sake of clarity, order, and missional effectiveness. A Baptist church should not practice infant baptism, and a Presbyterian church should not practice believer's baptism only. This is not sectarianism—it is integrity.

The boundary between secondary and primary can also shift when a secondary issue is weaponized to undermine a primary doctrine. For example, baptismal regeneration (the belief that baptism itself saves) distorts justification by faith alone and therefore becomes a gospel issue. The mode of baptism is secondary; the efficacy of baptism as a saving act is primary.

---

## Matters of Conscience: Liberty Without License

An issue qualifies as a matter of conscience only when:

- Scripture gives no binding command
- Both positions do not violate God's moral law, creation order, or gospel terms
- It can be practiced unto the Lord in faith (Romans 14:6)
- It does not alter the elements of worship, ordained offices, or sacraments

### Examples

- **Dietary restrictions** (Romans 14:2-3) — Whether to eat meat or abstain is a matter of conscience, so long as it is done in faith and does not cause a weaker brother to stumble.
- **Alcohol consumption** (Romans 14:21; 1 Timothy 5:23) — Scripture condemns drunkenness, not drinking. Some may abstain entirely; others may drink in moderation. Neither violates God's command.
- **Sabbath observance** (Romans 14:5-6; Colossians 2:16) — Whether to observe a particular day as holy or to treat all days alike is left to conscience under the new covenant.
- **Clothing styles** (within the bounds of modesty—1 Timothy 2:9) — Cultural expressions of modesty may vary, but the principle of modesty is binding.
- **Cultural traditions** not tied to idolatry or syncretism — Celebrating holidays, using certain forms of music, etc., are matters of conscience unless they involve worship of false gods or syncretism with pagan practices.

> *"Whatever does not proceed from faith is sin."* (Romans 14:23)

### Warnings on Conscience

Two dangers threaten Christian liberty:

1. **Elevating conscience to law results in legalism** (Colossians 2:16-23) — Turning preferences into moral absolutes binds the conscience where God has left it free. The Pharisees did this, and Jesus condemned them for it.

2. **Using liberty to justify sin results in license** (Galatians 5:13; Jude 4) — Freedom in Christ is not freedom to sin, but freedom to obey from the heart. Grace is not permission—it is power.

Conscience is a God-given faculty, but it must be informed by Scripture and held accountable to it. A "clear conscience" that contradicts God's Word is simply a seared conscience (1 Timothy 4:2). Paul could say he had a clear conscience (Acts 23:1), but he also acknowledged that his conscience was not the final judge—God was (1 Corinthians 4:4).

---

## Structural Safeguards

### 1. Covenantal Filter

Old Covenant laws apply only through the fulfillment and reinterpretation of the New Covenant. This guards against Mosaic legalism. Not every command in the Old Testament carries forward unchanged. Christ is the end of the law for righteousness (Romans 10:4), and the Mosaic covenant has been superseded by the new covenant in His blood (Hebrews 8:13).

This does not mean the Old Testament is irrelevant. It means that it must be read through Christ. The moral law—summarized in the Ten Commandments and repeated in the New Testament—remains binding. The ceremonial law has been fulfilled in Christ. The civil law was given to Israel as a nation and does not apply directly to the church or modern states.

### 2. Posture Clause

Defiance in any category elevates the issue to primary; rebellion is always salvific. A person who refuses correction on a secondary matter reveals a heart problem that transcends the issue itself. The mark of regeneration is teachability (Psalm 25:9; James 1:21). Obstinate resistance to clear biblical teaching—even on secondary matters—raises serious questions about a person's standing before God.

This means that someone who is wrong about a secondary issue but humble and teachable is in a different category than someone who is right about a secondary issue but proud and unteachable. God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble (James 4:6).

### 3. Dual-Level Clarity

Some doctrines (e.g., baptism) may be secondary salvifically but primary ecclesially. This means that while disagreement on baptism does not necessarily exclude someone from salvation, it may require separation at the level of church membership or leadership. The Bible permits flexibility on some matters within the universal church while still requiring clarity and consistency within the local church.

A local church must have a coherent practice. It cannot baptize infants on Sundays and believers only on Wednesdays. But a Baptist church can recognize that Presbyterian Christians are genuine believers, even while maintaining that they are wrong about baptism.

### 4. Hermeneutical Integrity

All interpretation must uphold authorial intent, covenantal structure, and doctrinal coherence. God does not contradict Himself. The analogy of faith—interpreting Scripture with Scripture—is not optional. Any interpretation that sets one passage against another, or that makes God appear unjust, unloving, or inconsistent, is to be rejected.

This is why systematic theology is necessary. We do not interpret isolated texts—we interpret texts in light of the whole counsel of God. The Bible is one book with one divine Author, and it speaks with one voice.

---

## What Must Be Rejected

### 1. Reclassifying Clear Commands as Secondary

All attempts to reclassify clear commands of Scripture as secondary to preserve superficial unity must be rejected. This is often done in the name of "majoring on the majors," but it functionally silences God on issues He has spoken clearly about. When Scripture is explicit, we have no authority to declare it negotiable.

For example, the Bible's teaching on sexual ethics, gender roles, and the nature of marriage is not unclear. These are not secondary matters. They touch on creation order, the nature of God's design, and the gospel itself (Ephesians 5:22-33). To treat them as negotiable is not humility—it is rebellion.

### 2. Antinomianism Disguised as Grace

The modern notion that grace removes obligation is antinomianism, not gospel freedom (Jude 4). Grace does not nullify the law—it writes it on our hearts (Jeremiah 31:33; Romans 8:4). Obedience is the fruit of saving faith, not a threat to it.

Jesus said, *"If you love me, you will keep my commandments"* (John 14:15). This is not legalism. It is the definition of discipleship. Those who claim to love Christ but live in habitual, unrepentant disobedience are deceived (1 John 2:4).

### 3. Calling Clarity "Sectarian"

The cowardice that calls clarity "sectarian" when Scripture calls it fidelity must be rejected (Romans 16:17; 2 John 10-11). The world—and increasingly, the church—demands that we hold convictions loosely. But God demands that we hold His Word firmly.

To have clear doctrinal convictions is not arrogance. It is submission to revelation. To refuse to take a stand on what God has said is not humility—it is disobedience disguised as niceness.

### 4. Emotional Appeals That Pit Obedience Against Compassion

True compassion speaks the truth (Ephesians 4:15). Emotional appeals that reframe biblical clarity as "unloving" or "harsh" are manipulative, not merciful. Love does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth (1 Corinthians 13:6).

The most unloving thing you can do is affirm someone in their sin. The most loving thing you can do is tell them the truth—even if it costs you the relationship. This is what Christ did. This is what the apostles did. This is what we are called to do.

---

## What Must Be Affirmed

### 1. Obedience Is Not Legalism

Obedience to Christ is not legalism—it is faith working through love (Galatians 5:6; John 14:15). Legalism is the attempt to earn God's favor through works. Obedience is the evidence that God's favor has already been freely given.

We do not obey to be saved. We obey because we are saved. And our obedience—imperfect as it is—is the fruit of the Spirit's work in us, not a contribution to our justification.

### 2. Unity Must Be Rooted in Truth

Unity must be rooted in truth, not papered-over differences that misrepresent God or His Word (Amos 3:3). False unity is not unity at all—it is compromise masquerading as peace.

The apostles did not pursue unity at any cost. They guarded the gospel, rebuked error, and drew clear lines. They did this because they loved the church, not because they hated those in error. True unity is the fruit of shared submission to Scripture, not the result of overlooking it.

### 3. Grace Magnifies Accountability

Grace magnifies accountability, not minimizes it (Titus 2:11-12). To whom much is given, much will be required (Luke 12:48). The more clearly we understand the gospel, the more responsible we are to live in light of it.

This is why warning passages exist in Scripture. They are not threats to true believers—they are tests for false professors. If you can live in unrepentant sin and feel no conviction, you should question whether you have truly been born again.

### 4. God's Word Is Fire and Hammer

> *"Is not my word like fire, declares the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?"* (Jeremiah 23:29)

God's Word is not a wax nose to be shaped by human preference. It is a two-edged sword that divides soul and spirit (Hebrews 4:12). It confronts, convicts, and commands. Our task is not to soften it, but to submit to it.

---

## Summary

To violate primary doctrine is to worship a false god or preach a false gospel. To deny secondary doctrine brings disorder, not damnation. To elevate conscience above Scripture is rebellion in disguise. True liberty exists only in humble submission to the Word of God. We are not free to redefine His commands—we are free to obey them from the heart.

---

## On Ignorance, Sincerity, and Response to Truth

Scripture distinguishes between ignorant error and willful rebellion, but neither ignorance nor sincerity excuses falsehood. God is merciful to the humble and teachable, but He is just toward those who resist truth when it is presented.

### Ignorance Is Not Innocence

Paul "received mercy" because he acted "ignorantly in unbelief" (1 Timothy 1:13), not because ignorance was safe, but because he repented when confronted with truth. Likewise, Peter says, "You acted in ignorance," then immediately calls his hearers to repentance (Acts 3:17-19). Ignorance may mitigate immediate guilt, but it does not eliminate the need for correction and change.

The person who is genuinely ignorant—who has never heard the truth, or who has been poorly taught—is in a different position than the person who has been confronted with truth and refuses it. But even ignorance does not excuse sin. It simply means that judgment will be according to knowledge (Luke 12:47-48). The one who did not know will still be judged, though less severely than the one who knew and disobeyed.

### Sincerity Is Not Safety

Uzzah sincerely tried to steady the ark but was struck dead (2 Samuel 6:6-7). Saul offered an unlawful sacrifice in panic and lost the kingdom (1 Samuel 13:11-13). Sincerity without submission is still disobedience. The issue is not the temperature of our devotion, but the object and manner of it.

Many false teachers are sincere. Many cultists are sincere. Many apostates were once sincere. Sincerity proves nothing except that a person believes what they are saying. It does not prove that what they believe is true.

### True Sincerity Yields to Truth

Apollos was corrected by Priscilla and Aquila and became a faithful gospel preacher (Acts 18:26). The Bereans verified Paul's message with Scripture and were commended for it (Acts 17:11). Peter took Paul's public rebuke without division (Galatians 2:11-14). These examples show what genuine humility looks like: it listens, learns, and changes.

The mark of true sincerity is not how strongly you hold a belief, but how quickly you release it when shown from Scripture that it is wrong. Pride clings to error. Humility releases it.

### False Sincerity Masks Rebellion

The Pharisees claimed sight, and were judged more severely for it (John 9:41). Hebrews warns of those who sin after receiving knowledge (Hebrews 10:26-27). God rebukes not only error, but the refusal to be corrected. The mark of a hardened heart is not the presence of error, but the resistance to correction.

This is why Jesus said that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven (Matthew 12:31-32). It is not that there is some magical sin beyond the reach of the cross. It is that blasphemy against the Spirit is the settled, final rejection of the truth. It is not ignorance—it is willful, informed rebellion. And when a person reaches that point, they have placed themselves beyond mercy, not because God is unwilling, but because they are unwilling.

### The Test of Regeneration

The true mark of regeneration is a humble response to truth. To resist correction, defend error, or hide behind feelings is not sanctification—it is self-deception. As James 1:22 says, *"Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves."*

If you claim to love God but refuse to submit to His Word, you are lying—either to yourself or to others. If you claim to follow Christ but live in unrepentant sin, you are deceived. The test of life is not what you profess with your mouth, but how you respond when confronted with truth.

### What Must Be Rejected

- That sincerity sanctifies disobedience
- That ignorance is a refuge from judgment if it persists
- That emotional conviction is equal to spiritual submission
- That truth is determined by subjective experience or personal impressions

### What Must Be Affirmed

- That teachability and repentance are marks of saving grace
- That error, when exposed, must be repented of—not rebranded
- That correction is a mercy, not a threat
- That God is patient toward the humble but opposes the proud (James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:5)

## On Biblical Love and the Counterfeit "Being Loving"

True love is covenantal allegiance to Christ, expressed in both heart and deed, inseparable from obedience to His Word (John 14:15; 1 Corinthians 13:4-6). Love may be imperfect, but it cannot be counterfeit. Anything less than covenantal fidelity is not a weaker form of love—it is no love at all.

### What Biblical Love Is

**Love is the fruit of the Spirit**, not mere civility or sentiment (Galatians 5:22; Romans 5:5). It is supernatural in origin and character. You cannot manufacture biblical love through effort or good intentions. It is the result of the Spirit's work in a regenerate heart.

**Biblical love is transparent, truthful, and rejoices in righteousness** (1 Corinthians 13:6). It does not conceal, manipulate, or affirm sin. Love speaks the truth, even when the truth is hard. It confronts, corrects, and calls to repentance—not because it is harsh, but because it cares about the eternal destiny of the beloved.

**God's covenant love (ḥesed) is steadfast, electing, and transformative** (Deuteronomy 7:6-8; Romans 5:8). It is not generic goodwill but a committed, purposeful devotion. God does not love everyone in the same way. He loves His elect with a saving, transforming love that He does not extend to the reprobate. This is not cruelty—it is covenant faithfulness.

**True love disciplines and redeems but never deceives** (Hebrews 12:6). Discipline is proof of love, not evidence against it. A father who refuses to discipline his son does not love him—he hates him (Proverbs 13:24). God disciplines those He loves because He is committed to their holiness, not merely their happiness.

**The command to love even enemies is binding and non-optional** for all who belong to Christ (Matthew 5:44; Romans 12:20). This does not mean affirming their sin, but seeking their good—which always includes truth. To love an enemy means to pray for his salvation, to bless him when he curses, and to speak truth to him even when he hates you for it.

### What Biblical Love Is Not

"Being loving" does not mean affirming sin in the name of kindness. To call evil good is hatred, not love (Isaiah 5:20). The person who affirms a sinner in his rebellion does not love that sinner—he hates him. He values his own reputation and comfort more than the sinner's soul.

Civility or silence in the face of sin do not constitute biblical love. Niceness is not a fruit of the Spirit. Politeness is not the same as godliness. You can be the nicest person in the world and still be on your way to hell—and you can take others with you by refusing to warn them.

Outward performance while harboring inward contempt is not acceptable before God (Matthew 23:25-27). Jesus called this hypocrisy, and it is damnable. You cannot claim to love someone while secretly despising them. You cannot claim to serve God while harboring bitterness and unforgiveness in your heart. God sees through the mask, and He will judge accordingly.

God's covenant love is not indiscriminate or identical toward all people (Romans 8:29; Deuteronomy 7:7-8). God loves His elect with a saving, transforming love distinct from His common kindness to all. He sends rain on the just and the unjust (Matthew 5:45), but He does not save them both. Election is real, and God's love is particular.

God does not love sinners "just as they are" without transformation. This severs love from holiness and makes grace mere tolerance. God loves sinners enough to save them *from* their sin, not to leave them *in* it. To preach a love that does not call for repentance is to preach a false gospel.

### The Sentimental Distortion of Love

The modern church has redefined love as passive affirmation, emotional validation, or therapeutic encouragement. This is not the love of Christ. Christ's love confronts (Revelation 3:19), corrects (Hebrews 12:6), and calls to repentance (Luke 13:3). His love is costly—it cost Him His life. And it demands everything from us in return.

Sentimental love says, "I accept you just as you are." Biblical love says, "I love you too much to leave you as you are." Sentimental love avoids conflict. Biblical love pursues truth, even when it hurts. Sentimental love prizes feelings. Biblical love prizes holiness.

### The Delusion of Duplicity

The counterfeit religion of duplicity—keeping the peace outwardly while harboring contempt or unbelief inwardly—is what Christ condemned as whitewashed tombs (Matthew 23:27). Hypocrisy is not love. Tolerance is not love. Love is covenantal fidelity, aligned in heart and deed, never divided or duplicitous. It comforts the broken, confronts the rebellious, and endures in truth.

This is perhaps the greatest deception of our age: the belief that you can "love" someone while refusing to tell them the truth. The belief that you can smile at someone, affirm them, and remain silent about their sin—and call that love. This is not love. It is cowardice dressed in religious language.

### On Romanticizing the Greek Love Words

The common fallacy that biblical love can be reduced to four neat Greek categories (agapē, phileō, storgē, eros) must be rejected. This romanticized taxonomy imports sentimentality and false distinctions, flattening love into human categories. The apostolic witness defines love not by lexicons, but by Christ's covenant and the cross (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 13).

Modern preaching loves to draw distinctions between different "kinds" of love, as if the Greek words themselves carry inherent theological freight. But this is linguistic eisegesis, not exegesis. The meaning of words is determined by context, not etymology.

### Crushing the Myth of Agapē-ism

The sentimental claim that agapē always signifies holy, God-like love is a myth. Scripture itself destroys this: Amnon *agapaō'd* his sister Tamar (2 Samuel 13:15, LXX), and his so-called "love" was wicked lust, quickly turned to hatred. The meaning of love is not secured by Greek vocabulary, but by God's covenant and Christ's commands. Any system that romanticizes agapē as inherently divine is linguistic idolatry, not exegesis.

The Bible uses agapē to describe both God's eternal love for His elect and Amnon's incestuous desire for his sister. Clearly, the word itself does not determine the quality of the love. Context does. Object does. Manner does. To build a theology of love on word studies alone is to build on sand.

## On Backsliding, Apostasy, and Heart Posture

Scripture distinguishes between a true believer who backslides into sin or error, and an apostate who departs willfully from the gospel. Both may outwardly appear the same, but are revealed by their response to rebuke.

### The Backslider Stumbles, But Returns

David repented deeply (Psalm 51). Peter denied Christ, but wept bitterly and was restored (Luke 22:62). The Corinthian church repented after severe rebuke (2 Corinthians 7:10-11). These were not apostates, but sons under discipline. The mark of a true believer is not perfection, but a pattern of repentance.

Backsliding is real. Christians sin. Sometimes gravely. David committed adultery and murder. Peter denied Christ three times. The Corinthians were tolerating sexual immorality that even pagans found shocking. But in each case, the response to correction revealed the state of the heart. David broke. Peter wept. The Corinthians repented. This is what regeneration looks like.

### The Apostate Defends Rebellion

Apostasy is not ignorance or weakness. It is a hardened rejection of Christ and resistance to correction (Hebrews 6:4-6; 10:29). Apostates are not confused—they are committed to their own way. As 1 John 2:19 says, *"They went out from us, because they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us."*

The apostate does not stumble and rise. He walks away and does not look back. He does not weep over his sin—he justifies it. He does not tremble at correction—he resents it. He may have been in the church, participated in worship, even held office. But he was never *of* the church. His departure simply revealed what was always true: he never belonged to Christ.

### Heart Posture Is the Dividing Line

Even doctrinally sound people can be lost (Matthew 7:22-23). Even doctrinally confused people can be saved (1 Corinthians 15:1-2; 11:17-22). The difference is this: how do they respond when confronted by truth? Do they tremble at God's Word (Isaiah 66:2), or do they harden their hearts against it?

This is why doctrinal correctness alone is not proof of salvation. The demons have perfect theology—they know exactly who Jesus is (James 2:19). But they do not love Him. They do not submit to Him. They do not worship Him. Knowledge without submission is damnation, not salvation.

Visible fruit, doctrinal alignment, and ministry activity are not infallible signs of regeneration. A soft, trembling heart before God's Word is the only reliable proof.

### What Must Be Rejected

- That apostasy is simply advanced backsliding
- That doctrinal error alone defines a person's standing
- That fruit, gifting, or service guarantees salvation
- That love for "God" excuses denial of the God of Scripture

### What Must Be Affirmed

- That Christ keeps His sheep, even when they stumble (John 10:28-29)
- That apostasy proves a heart never truly regenerated (1 John 2:19)
- That self-deception is real, and observable (James 1:22-24)
- That the test of life is not just doctrine, but repentance (1 John 1:9)

## On False Humility, False Unity, and Gospel Compromise

Biblical unity is grounded in truth, not sentiment. There is no unity apart from submission to the Word of God. Humility is not the suspension of conviction—it is submission to divine revelation.

### True Unity Is Built on Doctrine

Christ broke down the wall between Jew and Gentile through the cross (Ephesians 2:14), not through relational tone or compromise. Apostolic unity was fiercely guarded by sharp correction and clear boundaries (Galatians 2:11-14; Romans 16:17). Unity is not the absence of conflict—it is the presence of shared submission to truth.

The modern ecumenical movement has inverted this. It seeks unity first and truth second. It prioritizes relationships over righteousness. It values cooperation over correction. This is not biblical unity—it is pragmatic alliance. And it will not stand the test of fire.

### False Humility Fears Man, Not God

Calls to "tone down" theological clarity in the name of humility are often cloaked pride—the kind that seeks human affirmation over divine approval. True humility bows to God's Word even when it costs relationships, reputation, or comfort (Acts 5:29).

False humility says, "Who am I to judge?" Biblical humility says, "Who am I to ignore what God has said?" False humility is silent in the face of error. Biblical humility speaks truth with trembling. False humility values peace at any cost. Biblical humility values truth above all.

### Compromise Is Not Peace

To leave false teaching unchecked in the name of "theological balance" is not gentleness—it is disobedience. Truth does not divide the church. Sin and error do. Jesus Himself said, *"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword"* (Matthew 10:34). The sword is His Word, and it cuts between truth and error.

Every generation wants to soften this. Every generation wants to believe that if we just emphasize love, avoid controversy, and focus on what unites us, we can have unity without division. But this is a lie. There is no unity with those who deny the gospel. There is no fellowship with those who worship a false god. To pursue unity at the expense of truth is to abandon both.

### Emotional Framing Has No Place in Determining Priority

Emotional framing and selective emphasis have no place in determining doctrinal priority. God's commands are not negotiable. Systematized disobedience—whether in church governance, soteriology, or sexuality—is not a "secondary issue." It is rebellion. The seriousness of an issue is not determined by how it makes us feel, but by what God has said about it.

This is the great deception of our age: the belief that tone trumps truth, that feelings determine facts, that emotional appeals can override divine commands. But God is not swayed by our tears. He is not moved by our protests. He does not adjust His Word to accommodate our preferences. His Word stands forever, and we must bow to it—or be broken by it.

### What Must Be Rejected

- That humility demands restraint when Scripture speaks clearly
- That relational tone trumps doctrinal truth
- That unity is preserved by avoiding hard lines
- That theological clarity is arrogance

### What Must Be Affirmed

- That loving correction is a mark of true unity (Galatians 6:1; Ephesians 4:15)
- That false teachers must be rebuked, not platformed (Titus 1:13; 2 Timothy 4:2)
- That biblical clarity must never be sacrificed to preserve alliances
- That real peace only flows from truth (John 14:27)

## On Schism, Separation, and Ecclesiastical Fellowship

The unity of the Spirit is a sacred trust to be guarded through peace and doctrinal fidelity (Ephesians 4:3). Therefore, the church must have clear biblical convictions regarding its relationships with other professing bodies.

### On Schism and Lawful Separation

**Schism**—the act of creating division within the body of Christ over secondary matters, personal ambition, or offenses—is a sin condemned by Scripture (Romans 16:17; 1 Corinthians 1:10). Paul rebuked the Corinthians for forming factions around personalities rather than remaining united in Christ. Schism is the sin of dividing the church over matters that do not warrant division.

However, **lawful separation** is not only permissible but biblically required when a church or denomination formally embraces heresy, tolerates gross and unrepentant sin, or abandons the marks of a true church (the right preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, and right practice of discipline). To remain in fellowship with such a body is not faithfulness but compromise, violating the command to "come out from among them" (2 Corinthians 6:17; Revelation 18:4).

The difference between schism and separation is the difference between dividing over preferences and dividing over principles. The former is sin; the latter is obedience. The former is rooted in pride; the latter in holiness. The former creates unnecessary division; the latter preserves necessary purity.

### On Ecclesiastical Fellowship and Cooperation

Spiritual fellowship and cooperative ministry are only possible where there is a shared commitment to the primary doctrines of the Christian faith, especially the gospel of salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, and the authority of Scripture.

Organizational unity cannot exist where doctrinal unity is absent (Amos 3:3). Therefore, partnership in ministry, pulpit sharing, and financial support must be withheld from individuals, churches, or organizations that deny primary doctrines as defined in this framework.

This is not sectarianism. This is discernment. It is not unloving to refuse partnership with those who deny the gospel. It is faithful. It is not arrogant to draw doctrinal lines. It is obedient.

While we pray for and show Christian charity to all who name the name of Christ, formal partnership requires a shared foundation of truth. You can be kind to someone without platforming them. You can pray for someone without partnering with them. You can love someone without affirming their error.

### What Must Be Rejected

**Sectarianism**, which refuses fellowship with genuine churches of Christ over disagreements on secondary doctrines. This is the error of those who make baptism mode, eschatology, or church government into tests of orthodoxy. These matters are important, but they do not determine whether someone is a Christian.

**Pragmatic or sentimental ecumenism**, which sacrifices doctrinal clarity for the sake of missional strategy, social action, or superficial unity. True unity is a fruit of the truth, not a substitute for it. The modern evangelical movement has pursued unity at the expense of truth for decades, and the result is a church that stands for nothing and falls for everything.

### What Must Be Affirmed

- That separation from error is not unloving—it is obedience (2 John 10-11)
- That doctrinal clarity serves mission, not hinders it (1 Timothy 4:16)
- That the marks of a true church are non-negotiable
- That partnership requires more than sentiment—it requires shared submission to Scripture

## Appendix: Modern Doctrinal Misclassifications

This appendix identifies common errors in contemporary evangelicalism where doctrines are systematically misclassified—either elevated beyond their biblical weight or diminished below it—resulting in false unity, doctrinal confusion, or the toleration of serious error. Each entry identifies the doctrine, the common misclassification, the correct classification, the violation of the framework, and why it matters.

---

### 1. God's Created Order for Men and Women

**Common Classification**: Secondary or Conscience  
**Correct Classification**: Primary (Salvific and Worship-Defining) when persistent and unrepentant  
**Framework Violation**: Violates the **Covenantal Filter** and the principle that doctrines tied to **creation order** and **persistent, unrepentant sin** are always primary.

**Why It Matters**:  
The biblical teaching on God's design for men and women is not a cultural application of general principles—it is grounded in God's creational design of male and female in His image (Genesis 1:27), the relational order established at creation (1 Timothy 2:12-13), and the covenant structure of marriage as a picture of Christ and the church (Ephesians 5:22-33). Scripture consistently grounds these truths in creation, not culture, which places them under the authority of God's unchanging design.

Paul is clear that persistent violations of God's created order for sexuality and relational structure exclude from the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). This is not a matter of conscience or secondary application. It is a matter of salvation, worship, and the nature of holiness.

To classify issues tied to God's created order as secondary is to treat persistent, unrepentant sin as negotiable. This violates the **Posture Clause**: willful, corrected-yet-unrepentant disobedience transforms any issue into a primary concern. When someone is shown the clear teaching of Scripture on God's design and refuses to submit, they are not merely in error on a secondary matter—they are in rebellion against God's revealed will.

**The Posture Test**: A person who holds confused views out of ignorance or poor teaching may still be regenerate. But once corrected with Scripture and they refuse to submit, defending their position as acceptable before God, **the issue becomes primary salvifically** because the heart posture is now rebellion, not confusion.

---

### 2. Women in Church Office (Eldership/Pastoral Teaching)

**Common Classification**: Secondary or Conscience  
**Correct Classification**: Secondary Salvifically (in cases of ignorance), but **Primary Salvifically when persistently defended after correction**; Primary Ecclesially in all cases  
**Framework Violation**: Violates **Dual-Level Clarity** and the **Posture Clause**—the principle that a doctrine can be secondary for salvation in cases of ignorance but becomes primary when willfully defended, and is always primary for church order and worship.

**Why It Matters**:  
The question of women serving as elders or exercising authoritative teaching over men in the gathered assembly is not a matter of cultural preference or spiritual gifting—it is a matter of **creational order** (1 Timothy 2:12-13) and the **structure of the church** as established by apostolic authority (1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9). Paul grounds his prohibition not in first-century culture, but in the creation account itself: "Adam was formed first, then Eve."

**The Content Test**: At the level of content, this is secondary salvifically for someone genuinely confused or poorly taught. A person who holds to egalitarianism out of ignorance may still be a genuine believer. However, this error cannot be tolerated within a local church's practice without undermining the biblical pattern for worship and leadership. This is **primary ecclesially**—a church must have a coherent, biblical practice.

**The Posture Test**: Once a person is shown the biblical teaching grounded in creation order and they refuse to submit, **the issue becomes primary salvifically** because the heart posture is now rebellion, not confusion. Persistent defense of women in eldership after clear scriptural correction is defiance against God's ordained structure for His church.

**For Churches**: A church that institutionalizes women in eldership is not merely wrong on ecclesiology—it is encoding defiance into its worship structure. This is **primary salvific error** because it represents systematic, corporate rebellion against God's revealed order. Such a church has made egalitarianism a functional doctrine that governs its practice, which elevates it to a matter of worship and therefore a matter of faithfulness to God.

---

### 3. Justification by Faith Alone

**Common Classification**: Sometimes treated as secondary in ecumenical dialogues (e.g., modern evangelical-Catholic statements)  
**Correct Classification**: Primary (Gospel-Defining)  
**Framework Violation**: Direct violation of the principle that **denying a primary doctrine results in preaching a false gospel** (Galatians 1:8-9).

**Why It Matters**:  
Justification by faith alone is the article upon which the church stands or falls. To compromise on this doctrine—whether by adding works as a co-instrument of justification, by affirming baptismal regeneration as necessary for salvation, or by treating Rome's Council of Trent as anything less than anathema—is to preach another gospel.

Modern attempts to downgrade this to a "secondary" issue in the name of unity with Roman Catholicism are not humility—they are betrayal. Paul did not treat the Judaizers' insistence on circumcision as a secondary matter. He pronounced a curse on anyone who preached a gospel that added works to faith (Galatians 1:8-9). The Reformation was not a tragic misunderstanding—it was a necessary defense of the gospel itself.

---

### 4. Theonomy / Mosaic Civil Law in the New Covenant

**Common Classification**: Sometimes elevated to Primary; often treated as safely Secondary  
**Correct Classification**: Serious doctrinal error that violates the Covenantal Filter; can become Primary Salvifically when defended after correction  
**Framework Violation**: Violates the **Covenantal Filter**—the safeguard that Old Covenant civil laws apply only through the fulfillment and reinterpretation of the New Covenant.

**Why It Matters**:  
Theonomy—the belief that the Mosaic civil law should be enforced by modern civil governments—errs by failing to recognize the **categorical distinction** between Israel as a theocratic nation under the old covenant and the church under the new covenant. The civil laws given to Israel were tied to her unique role as a covenant nation, a role that has been fulfilled in Christ and does not transfer to Gentile nations or the church.

This is not to say that God's moral law (summarized in the Ten Commandments and affirmed throughout the New Testament) is irrelevant. It remains binding. But the **civil penalties** prescribed in the Mosaic law (e.g., stoning for Sabbath-breaking, execution for adultery) were tied to Israel's specific covenant administration and do not bind the nations today.

**The Danger**: Theonomy is not a benign secondary disagreement. It is a **serious covenantal distortion** that threatens both the law-gospel distinction and covenant theology. It often binds consciences where Scripture leaves them free and can functionally reintroduce works-righteousness by treating the Mosaic code as normative for new covenant believers.

**The Content Test**: Many theonomists still affirm justification by faith alone and the sufficiency of Christ's work. For these individuals, theonomy may be serious error without being damnable heresy. They are wrong about the application of the law, but they may still hold the gospel.

**The Posture Test**: When theonomy is defended after biblical correction—especially when it functionally introduces works into standing with God, binds consciences as if the old covenant civil code were normative, or treats disagreement as unfaithfulness to God's law—**it becomes primary salvifically** because the system now threatens the gospel itself.

**For Churches**: Churches that enforce theonomy as a rule of faith and fellowship, requiring adherence to Mosaic civil penalties as a matter of orthodoxy, have made it a primary issue. Such institutionalization moves theonomy from serious error into the realm of binding consciences unlawfully and distorting the covenants.

---

### 5. Eschatology (Amillennialism, Premillennialism, Postmillennialism)

**Common Classification**: Secondary  
**Correct Classification**: Secondary (unless it results in Gospel Distortion)  
**Framework Violation**: Becomes Primary if it denies **final judgment**, the **bodily return of Christ**, or affirms **full preterism** (the belief that all prophecy, including the resurrection and final judgment, was fulfilled in AD 70).

**Why It Matters**:  
The Bible permits legitimate diversity in eschatological frameworks. Amillennialists, historic premillennialists, and postmillennialists all affirm the essential gospel realities: Christ will return bodily, the dead will be raised, the final judgment will occur, and the eternal state will be established. Disagreement on the timing and nature of the millennium does not undermine these core truths.

However, when eschatology is used to **deny the future, bodily return of Christ**, to **redefine the resurrection as purely spiritual**, or to **eliminate final judgment**, it ceases to be a secondary matter. Full preterism (also called "hyper-preterism") is not an acceptable eschatological variant—it is a denial of core Christian doctrine. The same is true of any eschatology that functionally denies the resurrection of the body or the final, visible return of Christ.

**The Posture Test**: If someone is corrected with Scripture showing that Christ's return, the resurrection, and final judgment are future, bodily, and universal, and they persist in denying these truths, **the issue becomes primary salvifically**.

---

### 6. Mode and Subjects of Baptism

**Common Classification**: Secondary  
**Correct Classification**: Secondary (Ecclesially Important, Not Salvific—unless tied to justification)  
**Framework Violation**: None when properly understood; becomes Primary if tied to regeneration or justification and defended after correction.

**Why It Matters**:  
Baptism is a divinely instituted ordinance, and disagreement over its proper mode (immersion vs. sprinkling) and subjects (believers only vs. covenant children) has historically resulted in denominational distinctions. However, Scripture does not tie one's eternal salvation to holding the correct view of baptism's administration, provided one affirms that:
- Baptism is a command of Christ (Matthew 28:19)
- It signifies union with Christ in His death and resurrection (Romans 6:3-4)
- It is distinct from and does not accomplish regeneration (contra baptismal regeneration)

Baptists and Paedobaptists (those who baptize infants) can recognize each other as genuine Christians, even while maintaining that the other is wrong on this issue. The **Dual-Level Clarity** principle applies here: baptism is secondary *salvifically* (you can be wrong about it and still be saved), but it is primary *ecclesially* (a local church must have a coherent, biblical practice and cannot baptize infants on Sundays and believers only on Wednesdays).

**When It Becomes Primary**: The error occurs when groups elevate baptism to a salvific necessity (as in Roman Catholicism, certain streams of the Church of Christ, or Eastern Orthodoxy), making it a means of justification rather than a sign and seal of the covenant. When someone is shown that baptism does not regenerate or justify and they persist in teaching that it does, **this becomes primary salvifically** because it distorts the gospel itself.

---

### 7. Universalism (The Belief That All Will Be Saved)

**Common Classification**: Sometimes treated as a "hopeful" theological variant  
**Correct Classification**: Primary (Heresy—Denies the Gospel and Final Judgment)  
**Framework Violation**: Direct denial of **primary doctrine**—specifically, the doctrines of hell, final judgment, and the exclusivity of salvation through Christ alone.

**Why It Matters**:  
Universalism is not a secondary issue or an area of theological exploration. It is a denial of core Christian doctrine. Scripture is unambiguous:
- There is a final judgment (Revelation 20:11-15)
- Not all will be saved (Matthew 7:13-14; 25:31-46)
- Hell is eternal, conscious punishment (Matthew 25:46; Revelation 14:11)
- Salvation is only through faith in Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12)

Universalism denies all of this. It redefines the gospel as God's universal love without His justice, Christ's work as a universal reconciliation rather than a particular atonement, and hell as either temporary or nonexistent. This is not a variant of Christian theology—it is a departure from it.

**The Posture Clause**: Even if someone arrives at universalism out of emotional concern for the lost, once they are shown that Scripture teaches the reality of eternal punishment and they refuse to submit, they have moved from ignorant error into willful rebellion. At that point, they are not holding a secondary view—they are denying a primary doctrine of the faith.

---

### 8. Prosperity Gospel / Word of Faith Movement

**Common Classification**: Sometimes tolerated as "excessive" or "imbalanced" but not outright heretical  
**Correct Classification**: Primary (False Gospel)  
**Framework Violation**: Violates the principle that **redefining the gospel or the nature of faith constitutes heresy**, not mere doctrinal imbalance.

**Why It Matters**:  
The prosperity gospel is not Christianity with an emphasis problem—it is a different religion. It teaches that:
- Faith is a force that manipulates God into giving health and wealth
- Jesus's atonement secures not only spiritual salvation but guaranteed physical healing and financial prosperity
- Suffering, poverty, and sickness are signs of insufficient faith

This is a denial of the biblical gospel, which calls us to take up our cross, promises tribulation in this world (John 16:33), and teaches that godliness with contentment is great gain (1 Timothy 6:6). The prosperity gospel redefines faith (from trust in Christ to a formula for manipulating God), Christ's work (from sin-bearing substitute to health-and-wealth provider), and the Christian life (from self-denial to self-fulfillment).

Paul pronounces anathema on anyone who preaches a different gospel (Galatians 1:8-9). The prosperity gospel qualifies. It must not be tolerated as a secondary issue or treated as a matter of emphasis. It is a soul-destroying lie that must be exposed and rejected.

### Summary Table

| Doctrine | Common Classification | Correct Classification | Why It's Primary (or Secondary) |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **God's Created Order (Men/Women)** | Secondary/Conscience | **Primary Salvifically** (when persistently defended after correction) | Grounded in creation order; persistent sin excludes from kingdom (1 Cor 6:9-10); Posture Clause applies |
| **Women in Office** | Secondary/Conscience | **Primary Salvifically** (when defended after correction); **Primary Ecclesially** (always) | Based on creation order (1 Tim 2:12-13); persistent defiance = rebellion; churches encoding it = corporate defiance |
| **Justification by Faith Alone** | (Wrongly downgraded in ecumenism) | **Primary** (Gospel-Defining) | Denial = false gospel (Gal 1:8-9) |
| **Theonomy** | (Wrongly treated as safely secondary) | **Serious Error**; becomes **Primary Salvifically** when defended and binds consciences | Covenantal Filter violated; threatens law-gospel distinction; can contaminate gospel when persistently defended |
| **Eschatology (General)** | Secondary | **Secondary** | Permits diversity unless it denies return of Christ, resurrection, or judgment |
| **Baptism Mode/Subjects** | Secondary | **Secondary** | Ecclesially important but not salvific; becomes primary if tied to justification and defended |
| **Universalism** | (Wrongly tolerated) | **Primary** (Heresy) | Denies hell, judgment, exclusivity of Christ |
| **Prosperity Gospel** | (Wrongly tolerated) | **Primary** (False Gospel) | Redefines faith, atonement, and Christian life; not Christianity |

---

### The Rule That Governs All of This

**Content Test**: Some doctrines are primary by nature because Scripture binds them to God's being, the gospel, creation order, or kingdom exclusion lists.

**Posture Test**: When any doctrine is **knowingly** resisted after clear biblical correction, the matter becomes **primary salvifically** because the issue is now defiance against the Lord, not mere misunderstanding.

Persistent, unrepentant defiance after correction is **always primary salvifically**, regardless of the content-level classification.

---

### Pastoral Application

This appendix is not meant to foster witch hunts or theological nitpicking. It is meant to train pastors, elders, and mature believers in **doctrinal discernment**. The modern church is awash in confusion because we have lost the ability to distinguish between what matters eternally and what does not.

Use this framework to:
1. **Protect the gospel** by refusing to treat its denial as a secondary issue
2. **Preserve church order** by recognizing that some secondary issues require ecclesial separation even when they don't require personal separation
3. **Promote genuine unity** by not elevating secondary or conscience issues to primary status
4. **Confront error** with clarity, not just kindness—because leaving people in doctrinal confusion is not love

The goal is not to divide unnecessarily, but to **divide rightly** (2 Timothy 2:15)—to separate truth from error, wheat from chaff, and the teaching that accords with godliness from the teaching that undermines it.

**"Contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints."** — Jude 3
